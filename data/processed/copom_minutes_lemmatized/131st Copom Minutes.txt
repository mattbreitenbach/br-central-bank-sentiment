monetary policy decision
copom reaffirm view express previous minute addition contain inflationary pressure monetary policy also contribute significantly consolidation favorable term macroeconomic environment economic activity data indicate intensity demand expansion continue quite robust increase probability important pressure inflation however import growth benign investment behavior continue expand robustly contribute slow process moreover despite uncertainty regard continuity rapid growth record international economy last year volatility increase observe global market last month prospect brazilian external financing forecast period suggest accord newly available information balance payment may represent imminent risk inflation scenario hand relevant inflation increase mature emerge economy recent month evidence intensification inflationary risk global outlook therefore although inflation prospect remain line target trajectory additional uncertainty surround inflation path copom emphasize main challenge monetary policy context guarantee maintenance positive result reach last year
