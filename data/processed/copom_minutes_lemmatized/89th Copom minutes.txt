relative stability august september median market inflation expectation next year decrease october next month market expectation decrease accordance trajectory inflation target september market expectation decrease result show monetary policy able coordinate market expectation converge trajectory inflation target suggest economic agent consider increase inflation september event nonetheless market inflation expectation increase reflect fact september inflation high project
inflation forecast assume maintenance selic rate exchange rate still point inflation adjusted target use assumption exchange interest rate forecast next month target forecast slightly high september meeting projection mainly due impact high projection readjustment regulated price next year even increase inflation forecast inflation trajectory coming month remain path present open letter send bcb governor ministry finance january
minute september meeting copom analyze risk wage readjustment collective bargaining agreement trajectory inflation readjustment far level accumulated inflation high project inflation next month consequence appear moderate increase real wage compatible recovery economic activity without generalized process set materialize
copom forecast inflation base model nature limitation uncertainty magnitude lag monetary policy transmission mechanism main impact reduction selic rate third quarter year economic activity still begin materialize recovery economic activity observe since third quarter mainly due improvement risk profile brazilian economy effect monetary policy yield curve previous quarter reason copom carefully follow recovery economic activity keep balanced avoid inflation pressure monitoring important consequence change real interest rate recent month however progressive consolidation favorable prospect recently observe inflation copom consider room additional cut selic rate future
since forecast month ahead inflation remain target market expectation continue converge trajectory target favorable external scenario contribute price stability copom decide fix selic rate target continue process monetary policy easing
