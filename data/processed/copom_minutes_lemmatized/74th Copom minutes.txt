high variation free market administer price july already expect thus cause upward revision inflation projection however increase inflation projection due exchange rate depreciation occur since copom july meeting inflation expect project inflation still target
low inflation comparison may explain set factor firstly exist idle capacity economy tend reduce inflation tradable good price secondly administer monitor price forecast increase come year equivalent decline relation increase finally basic scenario one assume maintenance exchange rate level observe eve copom meeting absence additional depreciation furthermore predict large part impact recent exchange rate depreciation still occur due magnitude depreciation current exchange rate level existence idle capacity economy may insufficient soften exchange rate price course year base analysis behavior free price inflation first seven month year one may conclude moment sign significant accumulation exchange rate price would carry
despite projected inflation target copom recognize increase uncertainty relation realization basic scenario hypotheses end next year increase risk perception relation brazil industrialized country cause high volatility financial market foreign capital inflow context intervention foreign exchange market necessary manage excessive volatility exchange rate liquidity short environment avoid perverse dynamic foreign exchange market
