inflation expectation survey investor relation group gerin bcb rise since copom meeting july expectation increase reach probably due exchange rate depreciation observe period inflation expectation revise rise
inflation measure ipca july register june due behavior administer contract monitor price increase behavior free market price whose inflation high previous month inflation administer monitor price mainly influence readjustment bottle gas july gasoline july telephone tariff electricity administered monitored price would lead weak inflationary pressure august september mainly price reduction expect bottled gas
inflation free market price july mainly due exchange rate depreciation show variation february decrease significantly following month free price inflation reach july household food item free market price exclude correspond core inflation measure exclusion administered price household food item inflation increase july june variation core inflation measure symmetric method also increase reach july june
high variation free market administer price july already expect thus cause upward revision inflation projection however increase inflation projection due exchange rate depreciation occur since copom july meeting inflation expect project inflation still target
low inflation comparison may explain set factor firstly exist idle capacity economy tend reduce inflation tradable good price secondly administer monitor price forecast increase come year equivalent decline relation increase finally basic scenario one assume maintenance exchange rate level observe eve copom meeting absence additional depreciation furthermore predict large part impact recent exchange rate depreciation still occur due magnitude depreciation current exchange rate level existence idle capacity economy may insufficient soften exchange rate price course year base analysis behavior free price inflation first seven month year one may conclude moment sign significant accumulation exchange rate price would carry
despite projected inflation target copom recognize increase uncertainty relation realization basic scenario hypotheses end next year increase risk perception relation brazil industrialized country cause high volatility financial market foreign capital inflow context intervention foreign exchange market necessary manage excessive volatility exchange rate liquidity short environment avoid perverse dynamic foreign exchange market
increase uncertainty relation country future aggravate deterioration risk perception regard world economy since copom meeting july negatively influence asset price foreign local currency risk measure reach volatility exchange rate increase copom meeting july august exchange rate depreciate period
however agreement imf general principle support main presidential candidate reduction discount public security recent evolution mutual fund sector improvement liquidity condition international credit line brazil provide adequate environment revert expectation financial market
