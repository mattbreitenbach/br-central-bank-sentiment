global environment remain adverse volatile mark prospect potential global growth tightening financial condition major economy difficulty energy supply europe challenging scenario growth china partly due policy country reinforce slow global growth outlook come quarter
inflationary environment remain challenge normalization supply chain accommodation price major commodity recent period lead moderation global inflationary pressure turn low level labor market slack economy couple high current inflation high degree diffusion suggest inflationary pressure service sector last longer
process normalization monetary policy advanced economy continue towards contractionary rate synchronize across country tighten financial condition impact economic growth expectation raise risk abrupt repricing movement market committee note strong market sensitivity financial asset fiscal fundamental include advanced economy low liquidity several market environment call great caution conduct economic policy also emerge economy
turn brazilian economy set indicator release since previous meeting corroborate scenario slowdown growth expect committee release third quarter gdp figure suggest moderate growth rate previous quarter despite expansion component demand similarly labor market continue recover slow pace previous month
despite recent reduction especially item volatile affect tax measure consumer inflation remain high item relate industrial good reflect intense decrease producer price reduction pressure global value chain also show deceleration albeit still slow inflation component sensitive economic cycle monetary policy present great inflationary inertia remain range compatible meet inflation target albeit show marginal moderation inflation expectation collect focus survey around respectively
scenario risk analysis
reference scenario interest rate path extract focus survey exchange rate start evolves accord purchase power parity ppp committee assume oil price follow approximately future market curve following six month start increase per year onwards moreover energy flag assume green december yellow december scenario copom inflation projection stand inflation projection administered price committee decide emphasize horizon reflect relevant horizon mitigate primary effect tax change incorporate effect horizon refer second quarter inflation projection stand committee judge uncertainty assumption projection high usual
committee discuss speed global disinflation process one hand relaxation pressure global production chain well recent drop commodity price indicate movement continue short term especially industrial good energy food segment hand committee discuss give spread inflationary pressure service segment inertial nature environment tight labor market several country disinflation process slow observe recent episode
thus committee continue assess commitment determination central bank reduce inflationary pressure anchor expectation consolidate global scenario long tightening financial condition interest rate end tighten cycle maintain sufficiently long period contractionary level raise risk pronounced global deceleration
committee discuss two recent fact analyze international market firstly continue assess market sensitive development affect fiscal fundamental due combination high interest rate sovereign debt historically high level addition committee discuss low liquidity present sovereign bond market possibly due great uncertainty interest rate dynamic reversal asset purchase policy regulatory change issue require monitoring may also impact asset emerge economy strongly
data economic activity brazil continue indicate moderate pace marginal growth release third quarter gdp figure indicate reduction pace growth especially cyclical component nevertheless growth observe demand component supply side growth industry service moreover labor market data also indicate reduction pace job opening still positive marginal net hirings set release data include drop confidence indicator reduction credit granting together lagged effect monetary policy reinforce committee expectation slowdown pace economic activity worsen come quarter
inflationary outlook discuss base recent information member note benign movement commodity brl highlight additional downside risk ahead member emphasize volatile nature price environment pressured inventory finally member evaluate current inflation surprise significantly relation expectation substantially change understand future inflation dynamic moreover emphasize disinflation service core inflation component great inertia require increased attention perseverance conduct monetary policy
committee discuss extensively impact different fiscal scenario inflation analysis committee reiterate different channel fiscal policy affect inflation via primary effect aggregated demand also via asset price degree economic uncertainty inflation expectation neutral interest rate committee evaluate change parafiscal policy reversal structural reform lead less efficient allocation resource might reduce power monetary policy different exercise analyze evaluate final effect either inflation activity depend combination magnitude fiscal parafiscal policy furthermore highlight existence economic slack confidence debt sustainability determine factor expansionary fiscal policy achieve aim impact economic activity environment narrow output gap impact significant fiscal stimulus path inflation tends outweigh aim impact economic activity
committee believe still lot uncertainty prospective fiscal scenario moment require caution risk assessment committee reiterate continue monitor future fiscal policy development potential impact prospective inflation dynamic
emphasize risk scenario remain direction among upside risk inflationary scenario inflation expectation emphasize great persistence global inflationary pressure ii heighten uncertainty country future fiscal framework additional fiscal stimulus support aggregate demand partially incorporate inflation expectation asset price
iii output gap tight one currently adopt committee reference scenario especially labor market among downside risk note additional reduction price international commodity measure local currency ii deceleration global economic activity iii continuity tax cut assume reverse current scenario particularly uncertain fiscal side require serenity evaluate risk committee closely monitor future development fiscal policy particular effect asset price inflation expectation potential impact dynamic future inflation
discussion conduct monetary policy
copom discuss conduct monetary policy consider set projection evaluate well balance risk inflation
inflation projection second quarter scenario use interest rate trajectory extract focus survey remain consistent strategy inflation convergence around target relevant horizon committee decide emphasize horizon projection stress decision conditional temporary nature tax moreover committee continue consider inflation projection also around target assessment reflect visibility scenario increase uncertainty point projection communicate committee long horizon
copom anticipates alternative scenario maintain tax exemption fuel materializes emphasize usual horizon include first quarter however assess relevant impact conduct monetary policy since primary effect measure already disregard
copom begin discuss evolution broad array data monitor projection inflation expectation output gap balance risk copom inflation projection show slight increase relevant horizon due increase projection inflation market price shorter term revision projection inflation administered price long term compare previous meeting median inflation expectation focus survey rise slightly remain stable however regard committee note concern rise average expectation uncertainty future fiscal dynamic consequence inflation dynamic discuss uncertain environment deem require serenity assess risk service inflation show moderation remain high level committee believe disinflation process component become clearer time finally regard output gap committee observe reduction degree economic slack third quarter due data revision release domestic variable believe gap widen relevant horizon
copom chose maintain interest rate reinforce need evaluate time cumulative impact observe intense timely monetary policy cycle already undertaken therefore committee member assess give data release projection inflation expectation balance risk lag effect monetary policy already significantly contractionary territory appropriate maintain interest rate level committee reinforce necessary remain vigilant assess strategy maintain selic rate sufficiently long period enough ensure convergence inflation
committee emphasize persist disinflationary process consolidates inflation expectation anchor around target committee emphasize hesitate resume tightening cycle disinflationary process proceed expect
monetary policy decision
consider assessed scenario balance risk broad array available information copom decide maintain selic rate committee judge decision reflect uncertainty around scenario prospective inflation even variance balance risk consistent strategy inflation convergence level around target throughout relevant horizon monetary policy include without compromise fundamental objective ensure price stability decision also imply smoothing economic fluctuation foster full employment
committee remain vigilant assess strategy maintain selic rate sufficiently long period enough ensure convergence inflation committee emphasize persist disinflationary process consolidates inflation expectation anchor around target committee reinforce future monetary policy step adjust hesitate resume tightening cycle disinflationary process proceed expect
