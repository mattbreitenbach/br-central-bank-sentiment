inflationary outlook discuss base recent information member note benign movement commodity brl highlight additional downside risk ahead member emphasize volatile nature price environment pressured inventory finally member evaluate current inflation surprise significantly relation expectation substantially change understand future inflation dynamic moreover emphasize disinflation service core inflation component great inertia require increased attention perseverance conduct monetary policy
committee discuss extensively impact different fiscal scenario inflation analysis committee reiterate different channel fiscal policy affect inflation via primary effect aggregated demand also via asset price degree economic uncertainty inflation expectation neutral interest rate committee evaluate change parafiscal policy reversal structural reform lead less efficient allocation resource might reduce power monetary policy different exercise analyze evaluate final effect either inflation activity depend combination magnitude fiscal parafiscal policy furthermore highlight existence economic slack confidence debt sustainability determine factor expansionary fiscal policy achieve aim impact economic activity environment narrow output gap impact significant fiscal stimulus path inflation tends outweigh aim impact economic activity
committee believe still lot uncertainty prospective fiscal scenario moment require caution risk assessment committee reiterate continue monitor future fiscal policy development potential impact prospective inflation dynamic
emphasize risk scenario remain direction among upside risk inflationary scenario inflation expectation emphasize great persistence global inflationary pressure ii heighten uncertainty country future fiscal framework additional fiscal stimulus support aggregate demand partially incorporate inflation expectation asset price
iii output gap tight one currently adopt committee reference scenario especially labor market among downside risk note additional reduction price international commodity measure local currency ii deceleration global economic activity iii continuity tax cut assume reverse current scenario particularly uncertain fiscal side require serenity evaluate risk committee closely monitor future development fiscal policy particular effect asset price inflation expectation potential impact dynamic future inflation
discussion conduct monetary policy
copom discuss conduct monetary policy consider set projection evaluate well balance risk inflation
inflation projection second quarter scenario use interest rate trajectory extract focus survey remain consistent strategy inflation convergence around target relevant horizon committee decide emphasize horizon projection stress decision conditional temporary nature tax moreover committee continue consider inflation projection also around target assessment reflect visibility scenario increase uncertainty point projection communicate committee long horizon
copom anticipates alternative scenario maintain tax exemption fuel materializes emphasize usual horizon include first quarter however assess relevant impact conduct monetary policy since primary effect measure already disregard
copom begin discuss evolution broad array data monitor projection inflation expectation output gap balance risk copom inflation projection show slight increase relevant horizon due increase projection inflation market price shorter term revision projection inflation administered price long term compare previous meeting median inflation expectation focus survey rise slightly remain stable however regard committee note concern rise average expectation uncertainty future fiscal dynamic consequence inflation dynamic discuss uncertain environment deem require serenity assess risk service inflation show moderation remain high level committee believe disinflation process component become clearer time finally regard output gap committee observe reduction degree economic slack third quarter due data revision release domestic variable believe gap widen relevant horizon
copom chose maintain interest rate reinforce need evaluate time cumulative impact observe intense timely monetary policy cycle already undertaken therefore committee member assess give data release projection inflation expectation balance risk lag effect monetary policy already significantly contractionary territory appropriate maintain interest rate level committee reinforce necessary remain vigilant assess strategy maintain selic rate sufficiently long period enough ensure convergence inflation
