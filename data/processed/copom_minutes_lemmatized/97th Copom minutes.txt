assessment inflation trend
identified shock impact reassess accord new available information scenario consider simulation assume following hypothesis projection evolution gasoline bottle cooking gas price maintain respectively projection household electricity price maintain yet fix telephone price copom revise adjustment estimate year low previous meeting regard regulate price total weight may ipca rise project previous meeting projection readjustment regulated price follow model endogenous determination take account seasonal component exchange rate market price inflation change maintain projection spread selic rate follow specification vector autoregressive model base selic swap rate eve copom meeting increase basis point second quarter basis point fourth quarter
regard fiscal policy assume consolidated public sector primary surplus target gdp following two year achieve related assumption consider previous meeting maintain
consider benchmark scenario hypothesis include maintenance rate exchange rate level observe eve copom meeting ipca inflation project target target accord market scenario take account consensus exchange rate rate survey investor relation group gerin eve copom meeting inflation project central target
monetary policy decision
may ipca inflation edge comparison april deviate market consensus similar previous month strong pressure stem market price second consecutive month tradable price present high increase price unusual feature unfavorable trend food price national index also edge may like april wholesale inflation also increase contrary previous month main pressure stem agriculture price industrial price change decelerate wholesale price consumer price remain usual price continue decelerate due recent trend commodity price agriculture price however represent important source pressure inflation short run large seasonal pattern time year
may ipca core measure remain relatively stable compare april core inflation calculate method without smoothing procedure item rise respectively core inflation exclude food item regulate price stand year may core calculate method continue close headline inflation without smooth change respectively differently core exclusion rise
recent economic activity indicator confirm undoubtedly continuity economic rebound process initiate second quarter recovery trend corroborate gdp figure first quarter real gdp grow seasonally adjust comparison quarter real gdp rise order achieve estimate growth rate year necessary gdp grow average per quarter next three quarter extremely unrealistic scenario seasonally adjust gdp remain flat next three quarter gdp would grow
industrial production level march maintain april growth prospect remain favorable industrial production grow april seasonally adjust accumulate growth year compare period capital good durable consumer good category lead industrial growth cycle accord cni data seasonally adjust bcb real industrial sale grow april confirm growth trend initiate second half
april retail sale sustain growth pace reach high level since ibge initiate retail survey january sale grow compare march add increase period compare previous six month consumer confidence measure federação comércio estado de são paulo fecomercio sp fell june average index first semester still high level register period previous year credit operation continue expand individual company despite fall credit concession may several coincident lead indicator reinforce perception continued economic recovery package paper shipment grow first five month year compare period
even though export play important role economic activity rebound consequence significant adjustment external account domestic demand increase relative importance sustained economic growth importance tend broaden recovery employment real payroll lead high consumption april employment manufacturing sector increase real payroll register slight decrease although keep upward trend three reason employment growth yet reduce unemployment rate firstly period year usually characterize seasonal increase unemployment rate independently economic cycle secondly recovery process stimulate worker search job even search occupation time consequence labor force increase cause unemployment rate rise lastly unemployment rate calculate large urban area employment growth strong medium small urban area well rural area accord ministry labor employment level formal employment first four month year increase metropolitan region region compare period
brazilian external account continue register expressive positive result despite increase import trade balance post u billion surplus may historical record bcb revised upwards trade balance estimate year u billion u billion current account balance remain positive accumulate u billion surplus year may close estimate surplus whole year
external scenario somewhat stabilize since last copom meeting even though high volatility environment persist although tension oil market lessen still uncertainty regard expected path fed fund rate exchange rate remain slightly volatility reach high level since may country risk measure jp morgan chase decrease period immediately last copom meeting eve meeting
since last copom meeting oil price fall approximately follow opec decision increase output wholesale readjustment gasoline price announce petrobrás june stand close figure expect committee partially close gap internal external price
market inflation expectation deserve special attention member copom deterioration observe since last meeting limit ipca expectation median rise also affect expectation next twelve month median projection increase median anchor around move scenario temporary shock affect inflation path would reasonable observe sharp deterioration inflation expectation short horizon first order effect concentrate monetary policy effectiveness limit committee member share conviction magnitude deterioration observe long horizon compatible view presence eventual supply shock permanent nature monetary policy accommodate secondary effect deterioration also compatible inflation forecast produce different model use copom even projection take account particularly unfavorable scenario evolution main determinant recent shock
since meeting april copom assess inflation prospect base assumption low degree persistence first quarter inflation observe previous year seasonal relief market price inflation second third quarter consider inflation april may increase inflation may copom assess great emphasis inflation projection make without assumption low persistence inflation projection benchmark scenario base unchanged selic rate exchange rate throughout projection horizon point inflation rate target target market scenario take account exchange rate rate expect market eve copom meeting inflation projection remain target compare may slight increase projection scenario basically cause high inflation expectation
previous meeting copom also consider inflation projection next month correspond second half first half period inflation outcome sensitive monetary decision take next month time present reliable inflation projection one already available projected inflation period benchmark market scenario remain within central target establish national monetary council
regime central bank process base assessment different scenario important variable affect inflation dynamic current uncertainty concern external scenario responsible volatility tend increase inflation uncertainty consequence coordination private agent inflation expectation become difficult inflation rate increase cause either seasonal factor financial asset price volatility contaminate private expectation long period like previous meeting committee assess macroeconomics perspective still favorable however inflation expectation become relatively important risk factor last month
even consider less favorable scenario copom still optimistic achievement economic growth price stability consider hypothesis important external variable continue pressure long period flexibility regime could judiciously absorb primary shock associate pressure however would paramount monetary policy fight second order effect shock case economic activity could benefit progressive recovery real earnings depend price stability environment
result committee decide unanimously maintain target rate without bias
