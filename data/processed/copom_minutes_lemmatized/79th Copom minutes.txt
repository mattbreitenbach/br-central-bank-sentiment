assessment inflation trend
identified shock impact reassess accord newly available information scenario consider simulation assume following hypothesis
projection price petroleum assume hypothesis rise international petroleum price exchange rate change observe since last readjustment would pass domestic price case bottle gas increase final impact consumer price forecast gasoline decrease project coming year worth emphasize projection base current value cide december house representative approve authorization maximum readjustment cide charge gasoline per liter per ton bottle gas basic scenario compute readjustment whose direct impact ipca would around
projection household electricity tariff include elevation projection increase since last copom meeting consequence revision expectation important component readjustment criterion electricity tariff alteration relation projection release minute copom meeting november

exchange rate remain stable period copom meeting november december depreciated level help rapid adjustment balance payment also improvement capital account growth net foreign investment external funding commercial financing line also improvement risk perception suggest decline domestic interest rate fx coupon spread
however inflation rate increase significantly november monthly inflation rate measure ipca reach november high october september forecast november copom core ipca inflation calculate symmetric method increase november september october month november measure core inflation register increase
inflation expectation survey banco central brasil investor relation group gerin increase period last two copom meeting december november since september median inflation expectation double copom view factor could drive market significantly increase inflation expectation include view economic sector repressed exchange rate could lead pressure free price inflation ii uncertainty regard future conduct monetary policy iii inflation inertia associate high inflation register last quarter
copom inflation forecast also adjust upward consequence inertial effect high inflation last quarter deterioration inflation expectation impact exchange rate depreciation administered price
copom consider alternative scenario inflation expectation exchange rate decline faster scenario base recovery confidence brazilian economy also fact inflation last quarter strong temporary component agricultural high price international commodity preventive price increase temporary factor unlikely pressure inflation coming month sign albeit still incipient fipe index survey food price show decline speed price readjustment first week december moreover base historical average exchange rate brazil level inflation october november evidence restrained exchange rate still realize
nevertheless scenario deteriorate expectation rise inflation recovery economic activity probability price readjustment increase make convergence expectation level consistent inflation target difficult
mind copom believe increase interest rate may inhibit price readjustment help coordinate expectation hinder deterioration inflation expectation decision increase interest rate allow reduction inflation expectation
result copom decide unanimously increase target selic rate
