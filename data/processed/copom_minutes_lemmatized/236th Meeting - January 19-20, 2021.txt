copom member discuss evolution domestic economic activity light available information indicator evaluate despite partial reduction governmental transfer program available data end last year positively surprising however data capture effect recent increase number case prospectively unpredictability associate pandemic development necessary adjustment government spending increase uncertainty economic recovery committee considers risk associate pandemic development expected unwinding emergency transfer program may lead domestic scenario characterize gradualism even temporary reversal economic recovery
copom member debate level economic slack committee believe pandemic continue heterogeneous effect different economic sector transfer program government reduce slack good sector service activity however especially directly affect social distancing face great reduction demand prospectively evolution sectoral gap depend pandemic development adjustment public spending member committee point labor market data formal sector suggest overall economic slack reduce rapidly expect member however felt labor market data support conclusion
next committee discuss implementation monetary policy accord forward guidance introduce since meeting copom would reduce monetary stimulus long three condition meet copom evaluate two condition still hold fiscal regime change inflation expectation remain anchored however committee judge third condition longer hold inflation expectation well inflation projection baseline scenario sufficiently close inflation target relevant horizon monetary policy consequence committee decide drop forward guidance henceforth monetary policy follow usual analysis balance risk prospective inflation
copom continue analysis consider baseline scenario also balance risk inflation accord baseline scenario inflation projection around target relevant horizon committee also consider fiscal risk generate upward bias projection potentially justify increase policy rate earlier assume baseline scenario
copom member discuss impact asymmetry balance risk appropriate degree monetary stimulus particular member question whether would still appropriate maintain extraordinarily high degree stimulus give normalization economic activity observe recent month since may copom meeting desired degree monetary stimulus characterize extraordinary reversal disinflationary shock occur first month year reversal downward trend inflation expectation decline economic slack bring inflation projection baseline scenario closer target relevant horizon therefore member believe copom consider start process partial normalization reduce extraordinary degree monetary stimulus
lastly committee conclude despite normalization economic activity uncertainty regard future dynamic main economic variable remain usual next data release informative evolution pandemic economic activity fiscal policy thus benefit wait release decide next step monetary policy outweigh cost reason time copom deem appropriate maintain extraordinarily high degree monetary stimulus
monetary policy decision
take account baseline scenario balance risk broad array available information copom unanimously decide maintain selic rate committee judge decision reflect baseline scenario prospective inflation variance balance risk consistent convergence inflation target relevant horizon monetary policy include mainly
committee believe persevere process reform necessary adjustment brazilian economy essential sustainable economic recovery copom also stress uncertainty regard continuation reform agenda permanent change fiscal consolidation process could result increase structural interest rate
accord forward guidance introduce meeting copom would reduce monetary stimulus long specify condition meet base new information committee judge condition longer hold inflation expectation well inflation projection baseline scenario sufficiently close inflation target relevant horizon monetary policy therefore forward guidance longer hold henceforth monetary policy follow usual analysis balance risk prospective inflation
copom reiterate removal forward guidance mechanically imply interest rate increase since moment uncertainty regard evolution growth still prescribe extraordinarily strong monetary stimulus
