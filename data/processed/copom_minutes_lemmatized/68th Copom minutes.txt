assessment inflation trend
identify shock impact reassess light newly available information scenario consider simulation consider following hypothesis
inflation rate january measure ipca low observe december
projection consumer price gasoline diesel oil bottle gas make base price survey national petroleum agency anp indicate significant price reduction period since market liberalization january february march projection reflect price behavior future market brent type petroleum international petroleum exchange ipe propane gas new york mercantile exchange nymex
item include group price administer contract price liberalize recently fuel bottle gas behavior price although determine demand supply condition project accurately monitoring respective cost structure therefore wider set price administer contract also include monitored price refer definition item incorporate group weigh ipca maintain set price readjustment project january meeting readjustment project nonetheless percentage point increase inflation projection price administer contract basically concentrate january significant alteration inflation forecast rest year
projection readjustment electricity price adjustment incorporate energy price increase already occur year forecast next year
hypothesis previous meeting regard behavior slope domestic yield curve measure difference term di rate selic rate maintain average slope domestic yield curve rise gradually end
trend fed fund rate project base maturity future contract alter reflect average rate first quarter rise fourth quarter
sovereign risk premium stable trend forecast use global bond level
core inflation ipca calculate symmetric method decline significantly january december accumulate month core index increase core inflation calculate symmetric mean method rise slightly december january accumulate month core index increase core inflation calculate exclusion administered price consider wide set weight ipca january household food price increase january accumulated variation month
ipca increase last month reflect contribution free price monitor price price administer contract monitored price price administer contract expect increase direct contribution percentage point
regard fiscal policy assume primary surplus target consolidated public sector state government economic program achieve remain assumption make previous meeting maintain
simulation exercise several specification structural model lead conclusion maintenance interest rate current level exchange rate plateau eve copom meeting would result inflation around inflation project structural model base hypothesis maintenance interest rate exchange rate constant current level center target
monetary policy guideline
inflation measure ipca reach october continuously decline last month reach january core inflation measure trimmed average method also decline january latter sustainable trend reversion negative effect represent increase monitored price price administer contract adverse weather factor pressure recomposition profit margin effect responsible slow expect downward trajectory inflation
indeed spite significant reduction gasoline price beginning year gasoline register decline monthly ipca february survey national agency petroleum inflation monitored price price administer contract recede much expect due readjustment monitor price price administer contract influence projection bottle gas increase end subsidy item small weight index instance increase urban transportation price belo horizonte increase real estate tax são paulo porto alegre
pressure recomposing profit margin exchange rate may decline due important factor firstly due moderate expansion credit whose growth low last month secondly increase investment observe past year particularly result increase productive capacity economy trend associate existence idle capacity industry utilization capacity industry reach january accord fgv index december accord cni index level low observe absence demand pressure come real wage mass indicate economy may expand without additional pressure inflation besides end electricity rationing increase potential output growth finally inflation expectation survey investor relation group gci banco central brasil practically stable
external scenario improve require attention chance economy recovery already begin first half however outcome argentine crisis evolution domestic situation country merit monitoring moderate fluctuation exchange rate stability brazil risk indicate effect uncertainty international scenario worsen
management inflation target system require effort copom understand quantify several inflationary shock adequately calibrate monetary policy central bank forecast point inflation rate include primary effect shock come monitor price price administer contract inertia inherit describe open letter minister finance january primary effect shock monitor price price administer contract ipca value exceed inflation target deduct impact exchange rate inertia monitored price price administer estimate therefore deviation project inflation target center approximately equivalent contribution primary shock monitored price price administer contract deviation necessarily correct monetary policy inasmuch monetary policy orient towards eliminate effect supply shock inflation preserve initial alignment relative price
besides due magnitude supply shock occur copom understand appropriate time period eliminate inherited inertia may extend beyond calendar year one estimate inflationary inertia result part inflation exceed inflation target contribute additional ipca part inertia eliminate
last two paragraph give available information one conclude monetary policy target inflation rate within target range copom projection close low limit range monetary policy first glance could ease
treatment give supply shock base view direct effect shock suppress secondary effect inflation would return desire trend examine projection inflation beyond current year may test consistency understanding respect country manage supply shock examine projection inflation month ahead adjust monetary policy project inflation converges target time horizon brazilian case central target projection inflation reinforces recommendation scenario confirm monetary policy could ease
monetary policy operate lag decision consider past evolution relevant variable essentially future behavior copom projection future inflation embody high low degree imprecision depend observed economic scenario respect part member copom interpret domestic external scenario include recent fall inflation sufficient evidence confirm projection decrease inflation towards target member however consider sign still preliminary consolidation economic scenario still necessary may occur near future
discussion copom decide majority favor reduce target selic interest rate
close meeting announce committee would meet march technical presentation following day order discuss monetary policy guideline set calendar copom ordinary meeting publish central bank communiqué
