prospectve assssment inflaton trend
identify shock impact reassess light newly available information scenario consider simulation base following hypothesis
march inflation expectation due increase food price
international price oil remains volatile spot market price rise since last meeting future market still show decline trend along year consider implicit price schedule future brent petroleum contract average year around u per barrel
adjustment electric energy price remaining year revise back bulk occur third quarter expected change telephone charge public transportation fare also reassess timing size project change item domestic employee adjust light new methodology adopt april ibge regard set administered price include fuel energy public transportation telephone service expected average adjustment reach direct contribution year inflation percentage point
also include hypothesis food price variation stay overall inflation second quarter assumption relate harvest period tend partially revert unusual food price increase observe first quarter
accord projection implicit future market hypothesis fed fund encompass linear reduction current level end year remain stable thereafter
regard external scenario assume deceleration u economy concentrate first half year follow recovery beginning end second half recent deterioration brazil risk premium expect revert year compare last meeting scenario however introduce small upward shift brazil risk curve
hypothesis consider previous meeting maintain particularly one attain primary surplus target gdp growth adjust accord recent data release ibge
simulation use basic structural model conclude keep interest rate current level inflation projection although comfortably within tolerance interval inflation projection lie quite close target
ipca inflation core calculate method raise february march twelve month core inflation reach assessment ipca inflation core calculate exclusion item lead conclusion leave administer price food variation ipca remain around inflation core release getulio vargas foundation increase february march
median market expectation ipca inflation survey central bank daily basis present following evolution revise upwards reduce
monetary policy guideline
strong demand last month impact trade balance import grow fast pace export context deepening external uncertainty along unstable domestic political scenario contribute maintain pressure due complex combination factor outline passthrough variation domestic price subject considerable uncertainty
since last copom meeting economic environment change first estimate administered price change revise upwards public service charge likely raise previously expect tariff peg general price index affect pronounced influence rate variation wholesale price whole administer price tend account percentage point year inflation characterize major supply shock
second first quarter inflation stay central bank market expectation mainly due unfavorable performance food price close look inflation however suggest room partial reversion adverse effect food price improvement weather condition well crop reach marketplace shall contribute reversal likewise yet clear evidence increase passthrough product like poultry meet beef observe passthrough slightly expectation product however electronic appliance characterize high import content observe passthrough expectation nevertheless deterioration agent expectation indicate possibility great pressure passthrough future extent gdp growth stabilize moderate level pressure mitigate due great difficulty transfer cost price final good
respect positive change scenario shall underline broadening fiscal effort embody budget guideline proposal next two year additional cut half percentage point u basic interest rate latter shall mitigate impact u growth deceleration world economy improve global liquidity condition
domestic interest rate term structure show steep positive slope result reduction supply credit financial intermediary expect turn may lead moderation rate economic growth recent activity indicator retail sale reinforce prospect stabilization economic activity level case trend confirm seem probable additional inflationary pressure next year
copom consider understanding basic concept guide action reinforce
main objective central bank control inflation accord target establish government central bank main objective differently previous policy regime level exchange rate target central bank likewise specific price economy hence exchange rate variation relevant extent may affect ipca inflation rate give relationship inflation exchange rate depend upon variety factor whether currency depreciation temporary permanent whether passthrough price essential stress target inflation rate exchange rate
main policy instrument central bank interest rate monetary policy instrument complementary instance case liquidity shortage high volatility sporadic intervention foreign exchange market instrumental allow consistent price formation applies case bond
impact monetary policy inflation instantaneous lag central bank policy action effect economy require copom take preemptive action anticipate inflationary pressure instead react base lagged information risk late process control inflation lead high uncertainty damage economic activity potential economic growth
central bank pursues target trajectory inflation tolerance interval percentage point tolerance margin large since target define headline inflation core purged index contemplate escape clause usual inflation target country nevertheless central bank aim central point annual target relevant distinction make rigor plan objective posteriori performance assessment analogous riffle shooter would content hit target board always seek hit bull eye surroundings
assess central bank may use tolerance interval require identification cause lead deviation underlying cause demand shock interest rate must adjust bring aggregate demand back trajectory cause consist supply shock consensus among majority central bank effect fight direct effect shock price level thus case negative shock action take let deviation target temporary reasoning symmetric positive shock
necessary careful avoid change price level deviation inflation trajectory example supply shock one percentage point impact price level would imply increase one point inflation rate definition increase would remain embodied inflation rate next twelve month fade end period provide effect avoid require monthly inflation bring back level consistent desired path month right shock tolerance interval serve purpose guide central bank action circumstance help calibrate speed convergence desired trajectory inflation important aspect confidence bring inflation back target path
practice classify shock always easy task current economic condition encompass combination pressure one hand one take account effect expand domestic demand last month within context world economic growth contraction increase risk aversion hand overall adjustment administered price impact production cost represent supply shock economy whose effect need control turn depreciation exchange rate impact production cost good use import input also demand tradable good turbulent environment reinforce defensive nature economic agent reaction event argentina less extent domestic political environment suggest temporary nature part current pressure exchange rate
assess macroeconomic scenario present indicator increase core inflation last month observed inflation expectation uncertainty regard degree passthrough recent depreciation conclude initial move make march meeting consolidate order realign expected trajectory inflation target establish
consequently copom unanimously decide increase selic rate target
close meeting announce committee would meet may pm technical presentation following day pm order discuss monetary policy guideline set calendar copom ordinary meeting publish central bank communiqu辿
