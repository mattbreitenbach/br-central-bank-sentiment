monetary policy decision
copom evaluate monetary policy contribute consolidation favorable macroeconomic environment economic activity data indicate intensity demand expansion continue quite robust responsible least partially inflationary pressure observe despite import growth benign investment behavior even context moderate deceleration global growth year high volatility observe global market since committee believe prospect brazilian external financing forecast period suggest accord newly available information balance payment represent imminent risk inflation scenario hand relevant inflationary pressure continue present mature emerge economy evidence existence inflationary risk global outlook copom reaffirm vision brazilian inflation alternative scenario intense generalized global deceleration would cause risk factor ambiguous signal one hand decrease net export would act factor restrain aggregate demand moreover potential decrease important commodity price could contribute low domestic inflation hand alternative scenario could unfavorably impact inflation prospect two mechanism case deceleration mature economies comprise global financial market center risk aversion could increase result decreased demand brazilian asset depreciation price moreover medium run possible reduction net export could similarly affect price sustainability certain brazilian asset therefore although inflation prospect remain line target trajectory additional uncertainty surround inflation path risk materialization less benign inflationary scenario increase copom emphasize main challenge monetary policy context guarantee maintenance positive result reach last year
copom evaluate probability emerge local inflationary pressure represent risk domestic inflation trajectory increase heated demand market factor addition possibility existence supply restriction sector increase wholesale price consumer price inflation committee understand prospect well generalization local pressure initially focus consumer price inflation depend mostly inflation expectation remain carefully monitor additionally although external sector restrain inflationary pressure tradable sector heat domestic demand trigger inflationary pressure sector instance service sector context copom continue manage monetary policy stance gain obtain inflation control recent year become permanent respect copom carefully monitor evolution inflation several core inflation measure well inflation expectation within forecast period discriminate persistent generalized price increase promptly adjust monetary policy stance circumstance
preservation inflation rate line target path consolidation stable macroeconomic scenario contribute progressive reduction macroeconomic risk perception occur last year copom evaluate persistence cautious monetary policy stance critical increase probability inflation continue evolve accord target path materialize however important inflation indicator particular expected dynamic aggregate supply demand point persistent imbalance
committee emphasize important time lag transmission monetary policy stance economic activity inflation monetary easing cycle start september selic rate already reduce bulk reduction concentrate last nine month consequently neither activity level completely mirror effect interest rate cut yet effect economic activity inflation completely materialize therefore evaluation alternative monetary policy stance necessarily focus inflation scenario risk instead current inflation indicator
coming month credit growth real payroll expansion continue bolster economic activity mention recent copom minute activity level also reflect effect governmental transfer fiscal impulse expect next quarter consequently lagged remain effect interest rate cut increasingly robust aggregate demand add factor continue contribute significant way expansion issue become even relevant consider clear sign heated aggregate demand fact monetary policy decision concentrate effect second half later
copom recognize important contribution investment expand productive capacity factor together external sector help mitigate inflationary pressure however copom evaluate pace domestic demand expansion continue sustain among factor remain impulse derive monetary policy ease implement september continue present risk inflationary dynamic context consistent reduction mismatch rhythm expansion supply good service demand even relevant assessment different possibility monetary policy stance
aim consolidate stable predictable environment copom adopt strategy avoid volatile inflationary trajectory strategy take consideration lag transmission mechanism adequate deal uncertainty inherent process monetary policy formulation implementation reason variable inflation projection balance risk associate scenario especially preventive stance process copom important current moment characterize deterioration balance inflationary risk prudence assume even important role process
copom evaluate signal economy heating inflation expectation increase heighten risk concretization benign inflationary scenario inflation would remain consistent target path reflect projection context even consider moment maintenance basic interest rate adequate decision committee affirms ready adopt different stance adjust monetary policy instrument case consolidation divergent scenario project inflation target path
therefore evaluate economic scenario inflation prospect committee unanimously decide maintain selic target rate per year without bias committee monitor evolution macroeconomic scenario next meeting define next step monetary policy strategy
regime copom decide accord inflation prospect analysis several alternative scenario evolution main variable determine price prospective dynamic balance risk associate projection domestic demand continue expand vigorously economic activity dynamism include sector little expose external competition time effect important incentive factor monetary easing already implement still fully perceive contribution external sector benign inflationary scenario light robust domestic demand growth seem become less effective moment effect investment productive capacity economy still need consolidate environment monetary authority must remain vigilant avoid uncertainty contaminate long time horizon risk profile deteriorates matter imply shift inflation basic prospective scenario committee promptly adjust monetary policy stance circumstance
