discussion conduct monetary policy
copom member discuss evolution economic activity light available information indicator assess data release since previous meeting line expectation however data yet reflect impact pandemic brazilian economy hence little relevance prospective analysis
copom member continue debate size economic slack give available data copom conclude economy continue recover gradually close gap however current context pandemic measure economic slack become date
committee understand available information enough demonstrate pandemic extremely significant contractionary effect global activity fiscal monetary measure adopt main economy tend mitigate small share effect regard emerge country outlook quickly change favorable challenge international crisis increase risk aversion result reallocation asset cause substantial tightening financial condition
committee discuss pandemic affect brazilian economy particularly scenario prospective inflation copom conclude three main transmission channel first supply shock derive interruption production chain second production cost shock measure commodity price variation important financial asset third shortage demand derive increase uncertainty restriction impose pandemic
committee judge first effect small quantitative importance due brazilian economy poor interconnection global production chain second effect probably imply strong disinflationary impact short term however importance put perspective due temporary nature volatility commodity price measure local currency finally third effect tend quite significant relevant horizon monetary policy effect pandemic activity could substantial accord simulation present copom meeting offset third effect would necessary reduce policy rate percentage point
copom conjecture economy structural interest rate may evolve coming month committee view possible interaction deterioration external scenario frustration regard continuity reform possible permanent change public account adjustment process may threaten fall structural interest rate observe recent year
light perception committee consider reduction basic interest rate beyond percentage point could become counterproductive could result tight financial condition thus lead opposite desired effect base information available far committee see maintenance selic rate new level appropriate however committee recognize new information economic condition essential determine next step
copom member also discuss effectiveness monetary policy stimulate demand conclude although limit far effect become relevant accelerate economic recovery restriction impose pandemic start lift
finally copom evaluate balance risk around baseline scenario committee conclude moment balance risk high variance usual committee view great variance balance risk necessarily imply gradualism conduct monetary policy magnitude forthcoming monetary policy decision subject great uncertainty
