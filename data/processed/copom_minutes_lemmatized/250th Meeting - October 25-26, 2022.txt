inflation projection second quarter scenario use interest rate trajectory extract focus survey remain consistent strategy inflation convergence around target relevant horizon committee decide emphasize horizon projection stress decision conditional temporary nature tax moreover committee continue consider inflation projection also around target assessment reflect visibility scenario increase uncertainty point projection communicate committee long horizon
copom anticipates alternative scenario maintain tax exemption fuel materializes emphasize usual horizon include first quarter however assess relevant impact conduct monetary policy since primary effect measure already disregard
copom begin discuss evolution broad array data monitor projection inflation expectation balance risk inflation projection show slight increase long horizon reflect upward revision inflation market price short term small increase projection administered price committee assess projection remain value consistent strategy reach level around target relevant horizon inflation expectation focus survey show pronounced drop short horizon remain relatively stable long one risk remain high require continuous monitoring serenity assessment regard degree slack domestic economy committee continue monitor different metric strategy assessment output gap well current prospective activity considers decrease estimate slack since late update copom reinforce projection incorporate increase slack throughout monetary policy horizon result monetary adjustment undertaken recent quarter finally committee follow special attention evolution service inflation depend inflationary inertia output gap whose trajectory become clearer time
copom chose maintain interest rate reinforce need evaluate time accumulated impact observe intense timely monetary policy cycle already undertaken therefore committee member assess give data release projection inflation expectation balance risk lag effect monetary policy already significantly contractionary territory appropriate maintain interest rate committee reinforce necessary remain vigilant assess strategy maintain selic rate sufficiently long period enough ensure convergence inflation
