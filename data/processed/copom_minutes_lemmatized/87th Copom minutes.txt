recent evolution inflation
inflation rate july reflect lack price pressure confirm convergence inflation target wholesale price register negative change third consecutive month although fell less previous month consumer price index increase slightly result readjustment specific regulated price
ipca increase july decrease previous month accumulate increase month respectively fell july compare decrease june reflect increase july june decrease change decrease fourth consecutive month july reach respectively
ipca market price inflation slow july june consequence large decline food price regulate price rise july compare decrease previous month contribute overall result ipca july rise national fix telephone tariff main reason increase regulated price addition average increase energy tariff gasoline auto fuel price fell july respectively together contribute overall result ipca
wholesale price post negative change third consecutive month consequence decrease agricultural industrial price agricultural ipa fell july decrease june industrial ipa decrease july compare decrease june
core ipca inflation calculate exclude household food item regulate price fell july june accumulated change last twelve month reach decrease previous month first time year
core ipca inflation calculate method smooth reach july compare june last twelve month accumulated change increase continue reflect influence high inflation second half inflation calculate without smoothing procedure item result rate month month respectively
core inflation calculate symmetric method reach july accumulate increase twelve month end july
despite specific pressure trend indicate stable price august trajectory food price less favorable mainly due increase meat price deceleration fall price bean perishable food soybean product among regulated price gasoline stop contribute fall inflation addition increase energy tariff belém august são paulo july contribute increase inflation hand effect increase telephone price consider current judicial stance end august
assessment inflation trend
identified shock impact reassess accord newly available information scenario consider simulation assume following hypothesis projection readjustment gasoline price remainder revise new projection year readjustment stand significant increase compare july increase result exchange rate depreciation last month mainly rise international oil price projection bottled cooking gas remainder year stable however consider rise price occur july projection bottled cooking gas price full year rise projection readjustment electricity tariff increase projection readjustment telephone tariff maintain new distribution year due judicial injunction readjustment tariff accord annual variation item register change low expect july copom consider hypothesis differences authorize anatel actual readjustment compensate remainder year regulate price weight july ipca forecast rise increase compare last month projection increase projection consequence rise oil derivative price gasoline bottle cook gas household electricity tariff assume readjustment regulated price follow endogenous determination model regulated price methodology consider change exchange rate free price inflation change di well seasonal factor projection readjustment regulated price reduce projection spread selic rate follow specification var model use selic swap rate eve copom meeting third quarter gradually rise end
regard fiscal policy assume primary surplus target gdp year following two year accomplish related assumption establish july meeting maintain

monetary policy decision
behavior inflation july prove monetary policy able establish convergence inflation rate path inflation target assessment base increase ipca july also persistent quick fall inflation expectation exchange rate stability favorable evolution price index consumer wholesale factor provide evidence effectiveness monetary policy within framework consistent macroeconomic policy reduce inflation persistence prevent inflation rate stabilize high level peak final month
rise ipca june july result high inflation regulated price rise highlight increase expect face readjustment household electricity telephone tariff period inflation tradable good fall last two month may june july consequence exchange rate appreciation occur second quarter year inflation good almost zero third consecutive month result market price inflation weighted sum tradable tradable price change fall since march zero july another decline number item ipca suffer price increase also occur june july low share since may
change inflation dynamic also capture behavior core inflation wholesale price index core ipca inflation calculate method smoothing exclude regulated price fell fourth consecutive month
deflation wholesale price occur third consecutive month although degree deflation lessen july behavior observe industrial agricultural price consider positive impact agricultural harvest price almost exhaust also exchange rate remain roughly stable july deflation observe july attribute lagged effect exchange rate appreciation since march environment decelerate economic activity despite small exchange rate depreciation occur since july copom meeting still room deflation wholesale price contribute low level inflation consumer especially case tradable good even context recovery economic activity
exchange rate depreciate since july copom meeting range per u week august meeting country risk measure rise beginning august due rapid increase term u interest rate high volatility domestic scenario last week july decrease eve august copom meeting brazilian external account continue post positive result record trade balance due export growth surplus current account quick recovery rollover rate external loan moreover negative impact rise u interest rate likely compensate positive effect fast growth u economy global economy
due exchange rate depreciation observe since july copom meeting current level exchange rate equivalent average value second quarter year additionally accord bcb simulation exchange rate appreciation first semester yet totally pass price thus recent exchange rate depreciation expect produce inflationary pressure
level economic activity continue fall end second quarter june industrial production fell expect retail sale continue decrease industrial inventory desire level instal capacity utilization stabilize around unemployment rate remain high around mean economic activity recession since deceleration generalize activity important sector agriculture export grow strongly
prospect economic activity second half year good outcome first half economic activity particularly last quarter may benefit effect cut rate last three copom meeting recent reduction reserve requirement demand deposit increase real income may result decrease inflation important factor support economic activity due behavior economy second quarter growth second half take place low base expect july copom meeting large margin idle capacity thus recovery balance resumption consumption investment without significant inflationary pressure
bcb inflation forecast assume maintenance rate exchange rate point inflation adjusted target significant change inflation forecast inflation result july offset high forecast regulated price end year thus inflation forecast remain compatible present open letter send bcb governor finance minister january
bcb inflation forecast next twelve month still assume exchange rate rate remain constant point value target trend impact decrease interest rate exchange rate depreciation observe last month compensate low forecast readjustment regulated price next year significant decline inflation expectation
median market inflation expectation behave favorably market expectation decrease regard expectation inflation next twelve month decrease week july august copom meeting continue decline trend already observe june july reduction inflation expectation next twelve month value correspond path inflation target july finally market expectation decrease close target year
previous month effort evaluate degree inflation persistence copom compare inflation forecast model currently use alternative model adopt high degree inflation persistence inflation forecast july adopt current model precise provide evidence degree inflation persistence converge towards historical mean
monetary policy guide make inflation converge target path medium run real interest rate yield curve consistent target period transition current stage monetary authority establish interest rate trend permit gradual convergence real interest rate yield curve one prevailing guarantee inflation converges target low volatility output evidence inflation fall targeted path natural spread real interest rate equilibrium value diminishes
consider recent evolution inflation perspective future trend well significant improvement fiscal scenario medium long run consequence reform discuss congress copom believe ease monetary policy appropriate promote adjustment rate bring trend consistent gradual convergence real interest rate yield curve equilibrium position
thus copom decide unanimously fix rate target
close meeting announce copom would meet september technical presentation following day order discuss monetary policy decision establish communiqué october summary data analyze copom
