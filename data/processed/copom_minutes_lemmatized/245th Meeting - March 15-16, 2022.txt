copom specifically evaluate impact projection assumption path oil price usual hypothesis price per barrel start value around usd march rise around usd end extrapolate entire relevant horizon monetary policy oil price result particularly unusual global situation committee note current environment high uncertainty volatility demand serenity evaluation impact current shock therefore decide compare assumption price oil future contract negotiate international market well projection energy sector agency committee observe converge price per barrel usd end copom conclude would appropriate keep usual assumption reference scenario assume likely scenario alternative assumption path oil price end committee decide stick conservative assumption committee considers disclosure alternative scenario particularly useful informative highly uncertain environment
next copom discuss implementation monetary policy consider relative probability scenario evaluate well balance risk inflation consider great weight assign scenario alternative assumption oil inflation projection upper limit target tolerance band around target

increase least projected interest rate cycle entire relevant horizon since previous copom meeting weigh committee assessment projected interest rate path imply significantly restrictive monetary policy stance mainly impact inflation compatible tackle effect current supply shock however prospective scenario prove close observe reference scenario committee believe cycle even restrictive
next copom assess appropriate pace interest rate hike analyze inflation projection use simulation monetary policy path different terminal rate adjustment pace duration monetary tightening give volatility uncertainty current environment particularly global scenario committee opt timely interest rate trajectory embed scenario preference express caution regard probability award scenario measurement effect well commitment convergence inflation expectation target relevant horizon
base result copom member discuss appropriate strategy committee conclude adjustment percentage point follow additional adjustment pace appropriate strategy achieve sufficient monetary tightening ensure inflation convergence relevant horizon well anchoring expectation however committee recognize challenging scenario convergence inflation target reinforces ready adjust size monetary tightening cycle scenario evolve unfavorably
monetary policy decision
take account assessed scenario balance risk broad array available information copom unanimously decide increase selic rate committee judge decision reflect uncertainty around scenario prospective inflation even variance balance risk consistent convergence inflation target throughout relevant horizon monetary policy include mainly without compromise fundamental objective ensure price stability decision also imply smoothing economic fluctuation foster full employment
