discussion conduct monetary policy
regard international economy committee evaluate new information bring distinct impact different horizon short term pandemic resurgence resulting increase social distancing major economy interrupt recovery demand medium term however positive vaccine test result well monetary fiscal stimulus imply strong recovery perception economic slack extended period along communication central bank major economy create environment liquidity return capital flow favorable emerge economy
copom member discuss evolution domestic economic activity light available information indicator judge transfer program government allow relatively strong rebound durable good consumption investment however recent data continue reflect uneven recovery economic activity prospectively unpredictability associate pandemic evolution necessary adjustment government spending increase uncertainty economic recovery committee judge risk associate pandemic evolution may imply domestic scenario characterize even gradual recovery
copom member debate level economic slack activity committee believe pandemic continue heterogeneous effect different economic sector transfer program government reduce slack good sector service activity however especially directly affect social distancing measure face great reduction demand prospectively evolution sectoral gap depend pandemic evolution adjustment public spending
next committee discuss implementation monetary policy since meeting copom use forward guidance accord intend reduce monetary stimulus long specify condition meet committee judge condition continue hold inflation expectation well inflation projection baseline scenario remain inflation target relevant horizon monetary policy current fiscal regime change inflation expectation remain well anchor
copom continue analysis consider baseline scenario also balance risk committee judge moment upward asymmetry balance risk cause fiscal risk sufficient compensate fact inflation projection baseline scenario target relevant horizon committee therefore deem adequate current level monetary stimulus provide maintenance policy rate forward guidance
committee ponder interpretation forward guidance fiscal clause condition interest rate maintenance current fiscal regime committee reaffirm change fiscal policy affect public debt trajectory compromise fiscal anchor would motivate reassessment even spending ceiling nominal term still maintain reassessment would follow inflation target framework base analysis prospective inflation balance risk
finally committee assess next step monetary policy particular evolution forward guidance clause expectation inflation projection converge target evaluation copom convergence occur two reason increase expectation projection ii evolution horizon increase relative weight expectation projection moment close enough target thus committee decide add communication although forward guidance might withdraw soon would mechanically imply increase interest rate
monetary policy decision
take account baseline scenario balance risk broad array available information copom unanimously decide maintain selic rate committee judge decision reflect baseline scenario prospective inflation variance balance risk consistent convergence inflation target relevant horizon monetary policy include
committee believe persevere process reform necessary adjustment brazilian economy essential sustainable economic recovery copom also stress uncertainty regard continuation reform agenda permanent change fiscal consolidation process could result increase structural interest rate
committee deem adequate current unusually strong level monetary stimulus provide maintenance policy rate forward guidance introduce meeting forward guidance state copom intend reduce monetary stimulus long specify condition meet committee judge condition continue hold spite increase since last meeting particular inflation expectation well inflation projection baseline scenario still inflation target relevant horizon monetary policy current fiscal regime change inflation expectation remain well anchor
copom judge since adoption forward guidance inflation expectation revert decline trend relative target relevant horizon additionally next month become less relevant projection expect inflation around target scenario inflation expectation converge target suggest condition maintain forward guidance may soon longer apply mechanically imply interest rate increase since economic condition still prescribe extraordinarily strong monetary stimulus case forward guidance cease apply monetary policy follow inflation target framework base analysis prospective inflation balance risk
