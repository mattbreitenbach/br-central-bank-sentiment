update economic outlook copom
global environment become uncertain disinflationary process continue despite environment high core inflation resilience labor market many country time central bank major economy remain committed bring inflation back target either continue monetary tightening cycle signal prolonged period high interest rate fight inflationary pressure indicate pause period still cycle interest rate increase
committee note increase interest rate united state well forecast low growth china demand attention emerge market economy
regard domestic outlook recent set indicator suggest scenario strong resilience economic activity economic activity data second quarter particularly gdp release indicate persistence dynamic cyclical economic sector well expansion demand component relative household consumption generally speak sectoral indicator deceleration trade sector moderate reacceleration industry stability service sector growth strong growth pace previous quarter labor market remain resilient moderation margin
consumer inflation continue benign trajectory decelerate service core inflation despite decline inflation component sensitive economic cycle monetary policy great inflationary inertia remain target inflation expectation collect focus survey around respectively
scenario risk analysis
reference scenario interest rate path extract focus survey exchange rate start evolves accord purchase power parity ppp committee assume oil price follow approximately future market curve following six month start increase per year onwards moreover energy flag assume green december scenario copom inflation projection stand inflation projection administered price
committee evaluate international outlook uncertain disinflation process observe reflect reduction pressure commodity initial impact war ukraine early effect monetary policy tightening normalization productive sector slow decline core inflation look ahead uncertainty remain global inflation dynamic risk relate weather phenomenon war ukraine international oil pricing policy suggest possibility renew inflationary pressure furthermore labor market resilient output gap tight advanced economy environment still pressure service inflation several economy conversely central bank remain committed control inflation maintain tight monetary policy long period restrictive monetary policy advanced economy fundamental contain world inflation facilitate control inflation emerge country case global monetary tightening might affect domestic asset would lead slow domestic disinflationary process short term
global growth scenario characterize resilience activity labor market u oppose outlook low growth chinese economy context member see mild moderation activity major economy likely particularly u economy although sharp slowdown rule conversely member continue emphasize risk synchronized deceleration discussion committee evaluate part low chinese economy growth structural magnitude countercyclical response might implement help determine growth dynamic also impact commodity price brazilian economy
regard increase interest rate advanced economy copom ponder whether movement might reflect perception increased neutral interest rate country high potential output seasonal lack market liquidity high fiscal premium due persistent nominal deficit discussion copom mostly emphasize fiscal prospect particularly u would impact global financial condition
still external scenario committee discuss cause economic activity resilience observe several economy concomitantly disinflationary process even face historically strong monetary tightening cycle member note still high latent impact fiscal stimulus relevant economy however emphasize commitment central bank major economy bring inflation back target credibility achieve allow solid anchoring inflation expectation contribute disinflationary process sacrifice less economic activity
regard domestic economic activity committee hold debate resilient growth see recent quarter four possibility mention
first possibility strong performance agriculture livestock sector might indirect effect economic sector although corroborate data justify entire magnitude surprise another possibility expansion disposable income result labor market dynamic decline food price income transfer program also provide support consumption copom focus issue deem high relevance stress assumption growth sustain increase income corroborate resilience consumption service render household consequently committee also discuss possible impact dynamic service inflation growth sustain income consumption another possibility albeit low impact change would high neutral interest rate committee however decide maintain recent assessment neutral interest rate disclose june inflation report finally copom discuss whether potential growth would increase last quarter view regulatory reform institutional advance although judge premature reevaluate moment potential growth copom argues persistence resilient growth next quarter inflationary impact might future lead reevaluation potential growth copom perceive four possibility different implication conduct monetary policy
copom reinforce view lack commitment structural reform increase earmarked credit granting uncertainty stabilization public debt potential raise neutral interest rate economy harmful impact power monetary policy consequently cost disinflation term activity
discussion development labor market take place member still consider moderation labor market point slowdown pace hirings formal market decline participation rate member emphasize drop unemployment rate still high pace hirings formal employment committee agree evidence high wage pressure labor negotiation
consider recently release data copom judge output gap tight previously estimate continue anticipate scenario economic deceleration next quarter copom analyzed different output gap measure impact projection distinct assumption discussion copom judge element increase uncertainty estimate add upward bias revision output gap estimate use committee particular copom note impact pandemic period make difficult inference output gap
copom still assess deceleration credit granting line monetary policy stance strong deceleration observe corporate credit granting whereas household segment deceleration small less intense credit modality despite tight monetary condition copom emphasize transmission monetary policy cycle expect market interest rate new credit granting already see also increase dynamic capital market
finally copom assesses part uncertainty observe market increase risk premia inflation previously related final design fiscal framework currently associated execution revenue spending measure consistent framework achievement fiscal target give importance execution fiscal target already establish anchoring inflation expectation hence conduct monetary policy committee reinforce importance firmly pursue target
copom judge evolution current inflation scenario benign already expect committee believe disinflation dynamic still characterize process two distinct stage first stage show benign dynamic food industrial price trajectory wholesale price second stage begin recent period continue show benign dynamic food wholesale price addition deceleration price service underlying service discussion service inflation focus determinant member discuss realignment relative price role play labor market output gap inflation prospect hand component relate industrial good administer price might present less benign behavior previously expect due recent movement exchange rate price international commodity copom still assess inherent volatility food industrial good component suggest possibility abrupt reversal recommend caution debate risk relate el niño weather phenomenon partially incorporate reference scenario mention well relate international oil price development projection latter follow committee usual governance assumption copom highlight uncertainty surround el niño term magnitude period phenomenon would great impact particular impact different food product copom opt incorporate relatively small impact el niño food inflation projection member stress inflationary impact event extreme phenomenon end unanimously conclude contractionary cautious monetary policy need reinforce disinflationary dynamic
inflation expectation partially reanchoring still matter concern committee continue assess among possibility would justify target inflation expectation would fiscal concern fear global disinflation possible perception analyst copom could become lenient fight inflation time therefore copom assesses reduction expectation come firm conduct line goal strengthen credibility reputation institution economic framework
committee emphasize risk scenario remain direction among upside risk inflationary scenario inflation expectation emphasize great persistence global inflationary pressure ii resilience service inflation due tighter output gap among downside risk note deceleration global economic activity ii impact global inflation large expect synchronized monetary policy tightening
discussion conduct monetary policy
copom discuss conduct monetary policy consider set projection analyze balance risk prospective inflation
inflation expectation remain target relatively stable recently member particularly concern possibility deanchored target extended period secondly process disinflation continue service inflation decelerate margin member emphasize particular recent benign composition inflation decrease service inflation others stress underlying fundamental dynamic service inflation particularly resilience economic activity labor market yet allow convincing extrapolation recent benign behavior regard output gap tightening margin due great resilience economic activity implication alternative way measure output gap respective impact projection also assess finally note increase projection reference scenario mainly due tighter output gap change condition factor rise oil price foreign exchange rate depreciation reduction selic trajectory focus survey scenario evaluation member agree appropriate reduce selic rate percentage point adjust degree prospective monetary tightening
regard next step copom member unanimously anticipate cut percentage point next meeting judge pace appropriate keep necessary contractionary monetary policy disinflationary process pace bring together one hand firm commitment reanchoring expectation disinflationary dynamic hand adjustment level monetary tightening real term face benign dynamic anticipated inflation reference scenario projection copom also evaluate evidence ongoing monetary tighten beyond necessary inflation convergence target scenario still call caution reinforce view serenity moderation copom express committee judge low probability additional intensification pace adjustment since would require substantial positive surprise would raise even confidence prospective disinflationary dynamic confidence would arise significant change fundamental inflation dynamic much solid reanchoring expectation sharp widening output gap service inflation dynamic substantially benign expect
finally committee debate extension monetary policy adjustment cycle emphasize analysis need maintain still contractionary monetary policy relevant horizon consolidate inflation convergence target anchoring expectation copom emphasize extension cycle time depend inflationary dynamic especially component sensitive monetary policy economic activity inflation expectation particular one inflation projection output gap balance risk committee maintain firm commitment convergence inflation target relevant horizon reinforces extension cycle reflect bcb legal mandate
monetary policy decision
consider evolution disinflationary process assessed scenario balance risk broad array available information copom decide reduce selic rate percentage point judge decision consistent strategy inflation convergence level around target throughout relevant horizon monetary policy include year less extent without compromise fundamental objective ensure price stability decision also imply smooth economic fluctuation foster full employment
current context characterize stage disinflationary process tend slow partial reanchoring inflation expectation require serenity moderation conduct monetary policy committee reinforce need persist contractionary monetary policy disinflationary process consolidates inflation expectation anchor around target
scenario evolve expect committee member unanimously anticipate reduction magnitude next meeting judge pace appropriate keep necessary contractionary monetary policy disinflationary process committee emphasize total magnitude ease cycle throughout time depend inflation dynamic especially component sensitive monetary policy economic activity inflation expectation particular one inflation projection output gap balance risk
