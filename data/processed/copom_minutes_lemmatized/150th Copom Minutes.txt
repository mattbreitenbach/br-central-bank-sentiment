monetary policy decision
copom evaluate monetary policy contribute consolidation favorable term macroeconomic environment international market risk aversion improve since last copom meeting despite intensification volatility market recent week largely due concern sovereign debt european country indeed context abundant liquidity prospect external funding brazilian economy remain favorable line development price brazilian asset select commodity continue rise hand trajectory price index evidence resumption inflationary pressure relevant economy consequently benign impact international scenario domestic inflation path could come end despite persistence uncertainty regard behavior asset commodity price context gradual normalization international financial condition hand scenario may quickly reverse depend dynamic derive market distrust regard solvency european economy regardless aspect international outlook evolve copom reaffirm main challenge monetary policy ensure favorable result obtain last year preserve
