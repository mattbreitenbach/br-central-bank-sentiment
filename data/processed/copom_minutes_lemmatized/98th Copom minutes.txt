monetary policy decision
june market price inflation register high rate month last several year february may market price increase systematically regulate price accumulate regulate june however inflation pressure market price also regulated price partly due rise gasoline price thus result ipca variation month first half year market price surge equivalent annualized rate nationwide index also post high change last two month case may june respectively also record high change throughout year mainly pressure industrial price january
june period
ipca core measure stand relatively stable past month albeit figure incompatible inflation target first half year smoothed core post respectively annual figure respectively core inflation exclude household food item regulate price stand period annual term well headline inflation
economic activity continue present vigorous growth rate outstrip every month growth rate project end several lead coincident indicator anticipate continuous growth near future instance package paper shipment grow since second half rise june compare may data corrugate paperboard association abpo seasonally adjust bcb
may industrial production post historical high overcome previous peak november industrial production grow seasonally adjust compare may eighth consecutive positive rate period industrial output increase compare period last year real industrial sale increase may compare april reach high figure ever record series begin release december data national industry confederation cni seasonally adjust bcb
retail sale also keep growth trend initiate second half similarly industrial output sale also overcome historical record reach high figure index april sale grow may seasonally adjust increase compare month previous year sale expansion comprise almost retail sector one also one respond evolution real earnings july consumer confidence measure federação comércio estado de são paulo increase compare june
economic activity rebound cause increase manufacturing industry level capacity utilization reach record high recent year accord data seasonally adjust bcb quarterly fgv industrial survey report capacity utilization april high rate last three year monthly cni survey record may second high level series since december marginal production growth deserve special attention consider increase continuously last month suggest fast occupation exist idle capacity
conversely capital good sector present high growth rate amongst industrial sector year may capital good output grow compare period capital good absorption domestic production plus net import grow period environment combine fast demand growth recovery fix capital investment estimate output gap crucial evaluate inflationary pressure become uncertain stress june inflation report strong evidence capacity utilization heterogeneously distribute among different productive sector make important maintain favorable environment fix capital investment mainly sector low idle capacity thus enable output increase without cause inflationary pressure
although external demand play paramount role initial cyclical rebound domestic demand increasingly important unexpected consider relatively small share external sector brazilian gdp two major factor behind increase domestic demand credit expansion recovery labor market accord data produce cni seasonally adjust bcb employment manufacturing sector record february high level series since end still present continuous growth following three month may compare april similar trend also observe real payroll attain level equivalent verify first half june accord ministry labor employment formal employment increase accumulate growth rate first half compare period correspond creation million job high job creation first half year
june minute copom emphasize reason current economic recovery lag effect urban unemployment rate estimate brazilian institute geography statistic ibge reason include unemployment rate seasonal behavior labor force increase high expansion employment large urban area however may factor offset factor cause reduction unemployment rate april
brazilian external sector continue post sizeable result trade balance register u billion surplus june new historical high accumulate u billion surplus first half year marginal export import grow significantly bcb trade balance projection remain high level u billion despite economic activity rebound current account first half surplus reach u billion
external scenario improve since last copom meeting although tension persist mainly due new hike oil price pressure exchange rate country risk subdue consequence exchange rate appreciate reduced volatility country risk measure jp morgan chase decrease hand brent oil price fall june increase even consider favorable outlook last week due less uncertain monetary policy scenario completely consolidated indicate new episode volatility might occur future
deterioration market inflation expectation initiate may continue july especially median market expectation ipca year rise inflation expectation next twelve month increase
despite recent exchange rate appreciation deterioration inflation expectation june inflation increase expected annual adjustment fix telephone service explain increase copom inflation projection benchmark scenario projection base unchanged exchange rate throughout projection horizon point inflation rate target slightly target market scenario take account consensus exchange rate eve copom meeting project inflation rate one benchmark scenario target committee also assess third hybrid scenario consider market exchange rate expectation unchanged rate come inflation projection stand inflation outcomes estimate two usual scenario
previous meeting committee also analyze inflation projection next month correspond second half first half period inflation sensitive monetary decision take next month time present reliable inflation projection one full project inflation period benchmark market scenario stand slightly interval central inflation target
highlight previous copom minute unstable external scenario generate term volatility tend broaden uncertainty future behavior inflation one hand uncertainty diminish last week hand several factor responsible deterioration copom inflation projection since last meeting despite exchange rate appreciation period factor include increase inflation expectation upward review fixed telephone tariff acceleration economic activity pace
regard economic activity although fix capital investment recover level capacity utilization also increase reach historical high fast increase aggregate demand fix capital investment generate high uncertainty capacity expand supply good service without trigger inflationary pressure even consider monetary policy must orient accommodate primary effect supply shock recently observe important avoid secondary effect inflation increase contain upward revision inflation expectation addition also essential carefully evaluate current future supply demand condition economy
committee member believe maintenance current rate long period consolidate favorable inflation scenario convergence market inflation expectation actual inflation rate inflation target however monetary authority restate active policy stance adopt project inflation deviate target due eventual deterioration factor responsible recent increase inflation projection
even deteriorated inflationary environment respective change required monetary policy stance reason review economic growth expectation indeed fight effect shock recently observe monetary policy aim preserve sustainable growth promote balance aggregate demand expansion broadening productive capacity economy
consider reason state committee decide unanimously maintain target rate without bias
