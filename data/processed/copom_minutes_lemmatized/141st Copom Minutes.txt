monetary policy decision
copom evaluate monetary policy contribute consolidation favorable macroeconomic environment economic activity available data indicate pace domestic demand expansion significantly cool since last month amidst significant generalized economic activity deceleration economy develop emerge turn increase risk aversion unprecedented constraint observe liquidity condition international market unseen last decade continue impose adjustment balance payment therefore general term influence external scenario future path brazilian inflation continue subject apparently contradictory effect act distinct intensity throughout time surround significant uncertainty one hand economic cooling cause increase risk aversion impact demand brazilian asset consequently depreciate price hand generalized economic deceleration observe last month despite permanent may persist upcoming quarter cause cooling commodity price external demand also negatively impact local financial condition moreover trajectory price index evidence reduction external inflationary pressure especially mature economy also emerge economy consequence net effect global deceleration domestic inflation path seem far predominantly benign copom emphasize main challenge monetary policy context guarantee maintenance favorable result achieve last year inflation target systematically meet
copom evaluate probability initially localize inflationary pressure may cause risk domestic inflation trajectory continue diminish evidence substantial accommodation domestic demand moderation pressure market factor despite remain subject uncertainty reduce risk upward pressure observe end wholesale price show deflation last month consumer price committee evaluate materialization well generalization pressure initially localize consumer price still depend critically economic agent inflation expectation particular inflation expectation remain level inflation target spite reduction since last copom meeting continue closely monitor additionally worth notice accord available data behavior domestic demand exert less pressure price item service upcoming quarter anyhow committee reaffirm continue conduct action order ensure gain obtain inflation control recent year become permanent
copom emphasize important time lag implementation monetary policy effect economic activity inflation therefore evaluation alternative option monetary policy necessarily focus inflation scenario risk instead current inflation index point view even important period surround heightened uncertainty
prospect evolution economic activity continue deteriorate since last copom meeting although industrial activity data partially reflect process inventory retreat tend fade time particularly important notice effect international crisis domestic financial condition result severe decline credit contribution domestic demand support additionally intensification international crisis cause negative effect consumer businessmen confidence circumstance economic activity dynamism tend increasingly rely payroll expansion effect possibly enhanced governmental transfer occur hand contract effect international financial crisis domestic economy dynamism consequently context monetary policy despite permanent may become persistent consideration become even relevant consider fact current monetary policy decision concentrate impact upcoming quarter
