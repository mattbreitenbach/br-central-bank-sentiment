assessment inflation trend
identified shock impact reassess accord newly available information scenario consider simulation assume following hypothesis estimate price adjustment gasoline around include reduction beginning may projection readjustment price bottled cooking gas increase due increase april respect household electricity tariff estimate readjustment decrease result exchange rate appreciation reach rate could low charge public lighting several capital include curitiba são paulo fortaleza recife belo horizonte goiânia municipality great rio de janeiro regulate price weight april ipca forecast increase despite increase projection bottled cooking gas decrease gasoline price exchange rate appreciation consequent reassessment electricity price readjustment result fall april projection regulated price projection spread selic rate follow specification var model use selic swap rate eve copom meeting gradually rise end
regard fiscal policy assume public sector accomplish primary surplus target year following two year gdp related assumption establish
april copom meeting maintain
consider baseline scenario hypothesis include steady interest rate exchange rate level prevail eve copom meeting inflation project adjusted target
monetary policy decision
inflation remain downward trend wholesale price inflation decrease consumer price inflation evidence dynamic two group price different wholesale level exchange rate appreciation normalization supply perishable food main factor underlie decrease inflation
however deceleration consumer price inflation significant regulated price increase market price due item water sewage bottle cooking gas electricity urban bus fare airplane ticket motor oil cellular phone market price inflation decline largely due small price increase service item link exchange rate
gdp may close first quarter roughly stable comparison previous quarter one hand manufacturing output fell hand mineral extraction industry agricultural sector tradable good sector register positive performance
resistance rapid decline consumer price inflation point existence increased inflation persistence economy price important group consumption basket increase significantly although decelerate rate include beverage can product cleaning personal hygiene product furniture utensil consequently core inflation still remain high level
persistence due wage price readjustment occur since beginning year base high inflation rate accumulate last twelve month rather assessment future inflation also business make effort regain profit margin scenario fall aggregated demand behavior result significant decrease sale retail sale decrease first quarter year compare period previous year
copom believe monetary policy ratify price wage readjustment base past inflation due risk perpetuate high inflation
initial sign monetary policy curb inflation copom well market participant expect inflation maintain decline trend towards target favorable expectation regard inflation base following assumption inflation persistence temporary ii recent exchange rate appreciation positively affect price dynamic way exchange rate depreciation affect inflation
since inflation remain relatively high still premature conclude inflation persistence definitively decreasing effect exchange rate appreciation price significant thus copom conclude decrease inflation depend maintenance current effort
result copom decide unanimously maintain target rate
closing meeting announce copom would meet june technical presentation following day order discuss monetary policy decision establish communiqué october summary data analyze copom
