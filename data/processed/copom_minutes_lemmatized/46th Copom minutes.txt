monetary policy guideline
analysis supply demand point absence imbalance could generate inflationary pressure sufficient impact system inflation target consumption credit indicator confirm outlook strong improvement level activity course constitute source inflationary pressure austere fiscal policy follow government contribute positively price stability attenuation brazil risk foreign sector perform satisfactorily expectation recovery net export year solid monitoring farm harvest indicate real pressure year
overall situation would seem conducive price stability however supply shock represent international oil price rise internal government manage price expect second third quarter year risk factor closely monitored carefully quantify particular attention give recent upward movement oil price great source uncertainty increase volatility asset market price united state consequent albeit low level risk generate strong impact market base information discuss analyze copom conclude level volatility remain high time future
another question deserve committee attention relate uncertainty relate indexing employment compensation fund fgts though impact current public sector spending negative effect perception country risk raise sovereign risk cause immediate impact rate exchange
however alternative vision consider fact manage reverse expectation projected trajectory consumer inflation period approximately three month present time inflation expectation ipca move mark though still target another important indicator illustrate reversal core inflation register decline first quarter compare final quarter drop inflation occur midst negative supply shock occur case public sector tariff oil price rapid reversal trajectory domestic price midst negative supply shock suggest space reduction interest rate level effect country
copom position current real rate interest neutral word real equilibrium rate brazilian economy perception reinforce projection inflation recently publish inflation report march though current inflation expect trajectory compatible predefined target fiscal result prove highly positive preponderant position copom identify risk ignore uncertainty root following factor question value indexing fgts balance judge federal supreme court ii recent behavior international oil price iii external environment increase volatility international market expectation high interest rate united state impact brazil risk premium
