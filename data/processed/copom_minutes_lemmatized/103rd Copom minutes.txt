assessment inflation trend
inflation shock impact reassess accord new available information scenario consider simulation assume following hypothesis projection readjustment gasoline price increase regard bottle cooking gas projected readjustment revise copom project price gasoline bottle gas remain unchanged regard household electricity price copom reduce projection increase estimate projection fixed telephone price change remain readjustment project regulated price represent total weight november ipca increase project previous meeting projection still regard regulate price estimate increase
november copom meeting projection spread rate follow specification vector autoregressive model base swap rate eve copom meeting stand fourth quarter last quarter end
regard fiscal policy assume consolidated public sector primary surplus target gdp following two year achieve related assumption consider previous copom meeting maintain
assume maintenance rate exchange rate level prevail eve copom meeting ipca inflation rate project central target objective take account consensus rate exchange rate survey bcb investor relation group gerin eve copom meeting inflation also project central target objective
monetary policy decision
ipca inflation accelerate second consecutive month november increase october september acceleration mainly due regulated price increase especially fuel price acceleration happen despite decline household food price third consecutive month ipca inflation acceleration september november observe three component tradable regulated price
also accelerate november second consecutive month increase compare october september industrial inflation accumulate change january november measure accord production stage intermediary good increase period wholesale price inflation continue represent potential pressure consumer price coming month intensity depend prospective demand condition market inflation expectation evidence transmission happen yet intensity velocity observe past mean pressure definitely vanish
ipca core inflation continue accelerate november accord three criterion exclude regulate price household food smooth also accord two three criterion exclusion smooth accumulated change core inflation month ipca period core remain level incompatible inflation target
significant activity rebound mention copom minute year base monthly indicator industrial output sale employment ratify third quarter gdp result gdp grow first three quarter year compare period second third quarter seasonally adjust term industry sector increase accord criterion gdp data also confirm growth support domestic demand consider seasonally adjust data family consumption increase gdp second third quarter fixed capital investment also outpace gdp growth four consecutive quarter increase year seasonally adjust release third quarter data brazilian institute geography statistic ibge median market expectation gdp growth adjust upwards week previous november copom meeting
industrial output decline october seasonally adjust term decline however low suggest behavior lead coincident industrial indicator decline october lead credit sensitive industry durable capital good grow high rate several month industry show already anticipated qualitative change stimulate progressively sector income sensitive year october industrial output grow compare period previous year high rate since beginning twelve month industry grow
leading coincident indicator november anticipate new decline industrial output seasonally adjust series however discuss previous copom minute specific performance signal reversion industrial output growth trend strong isolated increase consider indicator acceleration production sequence growth rate witness recent past reasonable observe temporary accommodation since industrial activity rate volatile variation around growth trend
variation number work day make analysis monthly economic activity data even difficult particularly regard industrial output october working day compare work day month average last eleven year distort comparison year seasonally adjust data series correction distortion trivial number work day obviously affect industry produce day though direct impact industry continuous production cycle problem happen december inversely month work day compare thus recent monthly activity indicator clear release new data coming month
labor market continue improve significantly accord ibge urban employed worker real wage increase respectively january october unemployment rate decrease october compare previous month october october result equal december low value since ibge change methodology expectation additional decline last two month year accord ministry labor employment formal employment increase first ten month year compare period increase sector especially manufacturing sector data national industry confederation cni indicate continuous increase employment real wage manufacturing year october
retail sale increase september october accord ibge data seasonally adjust bcb sale nominal revenue increase respectively twelve month accord quarterly moving average sale automobile motorcycle along supermarket sale continue grow sale appliance furniture fabric clothes shoe decrease however appliance furniture vehicle motorcycle continue present high growth rate twelve month even recent accommodation retail sale accumulate growth rate ten first month compare period increase vary fabric clothes shoe sector appliance furniture sector
due significant activity expansion recent quarter performance aggregate supply come quarter continue important concern copom investment performance promise though level capacity utilization remain high domestic absorption capital good increase january october despite decrease october cause required registration oil platform produce manage domestically exported product cni instal capacity index decline october second consecutive month seasonally adjust term reach historical high august different output gap measure continue narrow even inclusion third quarter gdp data thus monetary policy continue monitor additional expansion demand
external trade surplus remain robust despite increase domestic activity export maintain high growth rate accumulate year november compare period export volume manufactured good represent large share among export around total expand january october compare period previous year due activity rebound import demonstrate similar dynamism increase january november import volume raw material durable consumer good grow respectively year october period twelve month end november trade surplus total u billion provide positive balance current account u billion gdp
favorable global environment brazilian country risk premium continue decline brl appreciate dollar prospect remain positive large part federal reserve feed probably continue moderate tightening actually liquidity remain favorable except short period second quarter market expect change fed stance since end copom work scenario low probability abrupt movement fed fund rate actually happen continuity favorable environment depend new economic data industrialized economy especially united state international oil price recent exchange rate move represent additional concern since process disorderly adjustment likely happen would cause significant instability international financial market
beginning december central bank resume purchase foreign currency emphasize communiqué release last january bcb aim increase country international reserve attain quantitative target policy continue base liquidity condition objective add volatility exchange rate market interfere floating exchange rate trend process understood therefore effort rebuild international reserve targeting regime floating exchange rate understand establishment target ceiling floor foreign exchange rate bcb also achieve since may extremely positive result regard decrease share public debt link exchange rate
reach record level october international oil price fall nevertheless still remain high level oil price prospect remain highly uncertain primarily due uncertainty regard continuity magnitude recent price correction case reduction oil price since october support copom forecasting scenario treat sharp oil price deterioration latent risk baseline scenario hypothesis domestic front copom project fuel price adjustment favorable international oil price scenario materialize possible may actually downward adjustment domestic oil product price next year emphasize september copom minute set inflation objective new inflation shock treat asymmetrically mean copom take full advantage favorable shock unanticipated reduction fuel price opportunity achieve inflation target set cmn
since november copom meeting median ipca inflation expectation deteriorate contrast median ipca inflation expectation improved fall nevertheless improvement could consider relatively modest light recent development reduce inflationary pressure next year sign moderation pace economic growth exchange rate appreciation reduction important international commodity price unequivocal sign restrictive monetary policy stance
copom inflation projection increase mainly due adjustment gasoline price projection benchmark market scenario decline relation november meeting benchmark scenario assume rate exchange rate exchange rate appreciation increase short end yield curve anticipation readjustment gasoline price small reduction inflation expectation compensate narrowing output gap cause reduction projected inflation however projection still remain objective word even rate exchange rate remain unchanged throughout level precede december copom meeting inflation would monetary policy objective projection base market scenario incorporate rate exchange rate project market eve copom meeting stand benchmark scenario due exchange rate depreciation interest rate decline expect projection period case project inflation would even distant target monetary policy
since september deviation copom inflation projection inflation target narrow however project inflation persists objective despite disinflation contribution reduction international oil price appreciation exchange rate evidence balanced economic growth order ensure convergence inflation targeted path copom member determine gradual interest rate adjustment process continue originally foreseen pace committee assume combination ongoing adjustment process follow sufficiently long period unchanged interest rate significantly reduce likelihood future inflation path diverges target
consider reason state copom unanimously decide increase selic rate target bias
stress november minute committee emphasize persistence monetary adjustment process originally foreseen pace magnitude require exacerbation risk factor committee closely monitor recent month interruption process convergence private sector inflation expectation inflation target copom prepare change pace magnitude monetary adjustment process assess risk inflation deviate target path
close meeting announce committee would meet january technical presentation following day discuss monetary policy decision establish communiqué october summary data analyze copom
