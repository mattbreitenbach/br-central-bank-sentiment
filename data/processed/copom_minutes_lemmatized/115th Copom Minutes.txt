monetary policy decision
copom reaffirm view express prior minute actual expect inflation result demonstrate monetary tightening cycle begin september contain inflationary pressure consolidate favorable macroeconomic environment economic activity recover coming month continue expand pace consistent supply condition introduce significant inflationary pressure addition despite continue volatility international financial market persistence high oil price external environment remain favorable particularly regard external financing condition country therefore benign inflation environment continue evolve november meeting committee emphasize main challenge monetary policy ensure consolidation favorable development
copom considers increase inflation period drive largely domestic fuel price adjustment implement well partial reversal favorable food price dynamic observe recent month since transitory pressure expect ease time without necessarily contaminate long time horizon nevertheless uptick inflation broadly expect september meeting magnitude significantly exceed expectation prevail time therefore committee continue closely monitor evolution headline core inflation coming month distinguish generalized persistent price adjustment adapt monetary stance circumstance order ensure gain achieve thus far reduce inflation make permanent
uninterrupted convergence inflation target path result consolidation long lasting macroeconomic stability contribute progressive reduction perceived macroeconomic risk process already underway several year scope reduction real interest rate future naturally follow copom consider cautious monetary policy stance critical increase probability inflation convergence target path materialize however important look inflation indicator remain compatible recent benign inflation outlook way gradual monetary easing compromise important achievement make lower inflation preserve economic growth job creation rise real income
consider current scenario copom unanimously decide continue monetary easing process begin september meeting two committee member vote reduction selic rate understanding would appropriate consider current balance risk activity inflation majority committee member however reduction adequate decision reduction would better fit optimal speed implementation easing cycle contribute increase magnitude total adjustment
copom therefore decide six vote two reduce selic target rate without bias
conclusion meeting announce copom would reconvene january technical presentation following day discuss monetary policy decision establish communiqué october summary data analyze copom inflation
