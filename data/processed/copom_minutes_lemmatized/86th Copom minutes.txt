deceleration market price inflation due mainly decline food price even upward pressure increase price rice milk dairy product decrease food price influence increase supply sugar cane bean corn increase supply corn affect meat price mainly chicken decrease regard sugar decrease international price prevail condition perishable food production remain favorable june support average fall price decrease may exclude food item market price increase june compare may reflect seasonal acceleration increase clothes price counteract general deceleration market price inflation
regulated price fell june compare rise may contribute overall result ipca june gasoline price gas station decrease result continue effect reduction refinery level since april decline fuel price intensify june reach due increase supply sugar cane decrease international sugar price recent exchange rate appreciation
wholesale price post negative change second consecutive month agricultural industrial price agricultural ipa decline small drop may consequence upward pressure meat increased supply grain vegetable fruit continue contribute decrease price product industrial ipa fell decrease may result influence decrease price chemical product particularly fuel lubricant fertilizer negative change important segment food product plastic metallurgical electronic material paper corrugated paper fabric clothing hand increase price industrial mineral product beverage furnishing wood rubber mineral highlight

monetary policy decision
monthly inflation continue decline observe recent month positive outcome mainly result monetary initiative impede propagation shock occur end consistency fiscal policy factor together favorable international environment lead exchange rate appreciation period convergence inflation expectation path target significant drop inflation illustrate result ipca june july provide evidence effectiveness monetary policy reduce inflation persistence prevent continuation high level additionally result strengthen perception convergence inflation target occur rapidly observe april
decline ipca june result drop regulated price increase free price number benefit several conjunctural seasonal factor decline gasoline auto fuel food price though factor take consideration market price show clear deceleration inflation exclude food market price inflation remain may june compare april
several measure core inflation drop may june describe similar trend see price index show drop inflation fifth consecutive month
outright fall ipca june accompany low proportion individual price ipca show positive readjustment compare may june rate significantly small register january high value series since low average observe since january
behavior exchange rate contribute drop inflation june july exchange rate remain almost stable u dollar float country risk measure increase slightly since eve june copom meeting rollover rate private security external loan continue increase june ipa strongly relate exchange rate post deflation second consecutive month deflation case industrial subcomponent ipa third consecutive month case agricultural subcomponent ipa
however effect tradable good price exchange rate appreciation occur since beginning far less intense expect behavior wholesale price partial delayed effect consumer price still room exchange rate appreciation occur since beginning affect ipca even though exchange rate remain stable around current level past month result although tradable good price yet embody exchange rate appreciation occur reasonable expect adjust absence additional upward pressure
deceleration economic activity continue decline retail sale increase inventory zero growth industrial production unemployment rate measure ibge increase may base upon new methodology may unemployment rate directly comparable value observe month past year highlight indicator available copom meeting still reflect lagged impact economic activity adverse macroeconomic environment prevailing final month first month copom remain aware evolution level activity believe recent deceleration reverse second half result effect recent significant improvement macroeconomic fundamental
central bank inflation forecast market inflation expectation converge inflation target central bank inflation forecast point inflation adjusted target nonetheless observe june copom meeting since second quarter year inflation register result compatible projection present open letter send central bank governor ministry finance january
median market expectation inflation survey gerin also converge inflation target week july copom meeting expect inflation next month drop value consistent ahead path inflation target july period median market expectation inflation drop
central bank inflation forecast consider baseline scenario hypothesis include selic rate exchange rate level point inflation rate accumulate next twelve month trajectory inflation target forecast new target fix cmn end june however period disinflation nominal interest rate expect fall gradually therefore forecast relatively long time horizon base constant nominal interest rate tend overestimate downward trajectory inflation
copom remain concern risk set inflation path consistent trajectory target especially respect degree inflation persistence speed disinflation copom compare inflation forecast model currently use alternative model adopt high degree inflation persistence inflation forecast second quarter adopt current model precise provide evidence degree inflation persistence converge towards historical mean
recent trend inflation persists real interest rate converge low level future gradual convergence interest rate towards new equilibrium level medium term preserve recent success fight inflation compatible sustained recovery level economic activity
consider forecast inflation next twelve month recent rate ipca evidence inflation persistence may return historical level copom believe additional loosening monetary policy compromise recent success reduce inflation
result copom decide unanimously fix target rate
closing meeting announce copom would meet august technical presentation following day order discuss monetary policy decision establish communiqu√© october summary data analyze copom
