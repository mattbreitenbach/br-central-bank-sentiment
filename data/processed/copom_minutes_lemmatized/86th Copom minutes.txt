deceleration market price inflation due mainly decline food price even upward pressure increase price rice milk dairy product decrease food price influence increase supply sugar cane bean corn increase supply corn affect meat price mainly chicken decrease regard sugar decrease international price prevail condition perishable food production remain favorable june support average fall price decrease may exclude food item market price increase june compare may reflect seasonal acceleration increase clothes price counteract general deceleration market price inflation
regulated price fell june compare rise may contribute overall result ipca june gasoline price gas station decrease result continue effect reduction refinery level since april decline fuel price intensify june reach due increase supply sugar cane decrease international sugar price recent exchange rate appreciation
wholesale price post negative change second consecutive month agricultural industrial price agricultural ipa decline small drop may consequence upward pressure meat increased supply grain vegetable fruit continue contribute decrease price product industrial ipa fell decrease may result influence decrease price chemical product particularly fuel lubricant fertilizer negative change important segment food product plastic metallurgical electronic material paper corrugated paper fabric clothing hand increase price industrial mineral product beverage furnishing wood rubber mineral highlight
core ipca inflation calculate exclude household food item regulate price decrease june may accumulated change last twelve month reach
core ipca inflation calculate method reach june compare may last twelve month accumulated change increase continue reflect influence high inflation second half
core inflation calculate symmetric method increase june compare may accumulate increase twelve month june case core inflation also influence high inflation second half
july effect exchange rate depreciation wholesale price decline agricultural industrial price likely register less deflation agricultural price may also reflect increase pressure meat milk dairy product price due seasonal effect price product sugarcane derivative industry may continue decline decrease agricultural price register second preview july compare second preview june already reflect effect

assessment inflation trend
identified shock impact reassess accord newly available information scenario consider simulation assume following hypothesis projection readjustment gasoline price remainder decrease since last meeting new projection year readjustment projection bottled cooking gas remain almost stable reduction june july meeting forecast include price readjustment occur current date projection readjustment electricity tariff fell slightly already include readjustment occur current date regard telephone tariff new forecast presume readjustment regulate price weight june ipca forecast rise decrease compare last month projection despite significant increase forecast readjustment telephone tariff drop projection continue consequence exchange rate appreciation observe recent month gasoline auto fuel household electricity tariff major price responsible decrease projection increase overall regulated price assume readjustment regulated price follow endogenous determination model regulated price consider change exchange rate free price inflation change igp price index well seasonal factor new methodology projection readjustment regulated price projection spread selic rate follow specification var model use selic swap rate eve copom meeting third quarter gradually rise end

monetary policy decision
monthly inflation continue decline observe recent month positive outcome mainly result monetary initiative impede propagation shock occur end consistency fiscal policy factor together favorable international environment lead exchange rate appreciation period convergence inflation expectation path target significant drop inflation illustrate result ipca june july provide evidence effectiveness monetary policy reduce inflation persistence prevent continuation high level additionally result strengthen perception convergence inflation target occur rapidly observe april
decline ipca june result drop regulated price increase free price number benefit several conjunctural seasonal factor decline gasoline auto fuel food price though factor take consideration market price show clear deceleration inflation exclude food market price inflation remain may june compare april
several measure core inflation drop may june describe similar trend see price index show drop inflation fifth consecutive month
outright fall ipca june accompany low proportion individual price ipca show positive readjustment compare may june rate significantly small register january high value series since low average observe since january
behavior exchange rate contribute drop inflation june july exchange rate remain almost stable u dollar float country risk measure increase slightly since eve june copom meeting rollover rate private security external loan continue increase june ipa strongly relate exchange rate post deflation second consecutive month deflation case industrial subcomponent ipa third consecutive month case agricultural subcomponent ipa
however effect tradable good price exchange rate appreciation occur since beginning far less intense expect behavior wholesale price partial delayed effect consumer price still room exchange rate appreciation occur since beginning affect ipca even though exchange rate remain stable around current level past month result although tradable good price yet embody exchange rate appreciation occur reasonable expect adjust absence additional upward pressure
deceleration economic activity continue decline retail sale increase inventory zero growth industrial production unemployment rate measure ibge increase may base upon new methodology may unemployment rate directly comparable value observe month past year highlight indicator available copom meeting still reflect lagged impact economic activity adverse macroeconomic environment prevailing final month first month copom remain aware evolution level activity believe recent deceleration reverse second half result effect recent significant improvement macroeconomic fundamental
central bank inflation forecast market inflation expectation converge inflation target central bank inflation forecast point inflation adjusted target nonetheless observe june copom meeting since second quarter year inflation register result compatible projection present open letter send central bank governor ministry finance january
median market expectation inflation survey gerin also converge inflation target week july copom meeting expect inflation next month drop value consistent ahead path inflation target july period median market expectation inflation drop
central bank inflation forecast consider baseline scenario hypothesis include selic rate exchange rate level point inflation rate accumulate next twelve month trajectory inflation target forecast new target fix cmn end june however period disinflation nominal interest rate expect fall gradually therefore forecast relatively long time horizon base constant nominal interest rate tend overestimate downward trajectory inflation
copom remain concern risk set inflation path consistent trajectory target especially respect degree inflation persistence speed disinflation copom compare inflation forecast model currently use alternative model adopt high degree inflation persistence inflation forecast second quarter adopt current model precise provide evidence degree inflation persistence converge towards historical mean
recent trend inflation persists real interest rate converge low level future gradual convergence interest rate towards new equilibrium level medium term preserve recent success fight inflation compatible sustained recovery level economic activity
consider forecast inflation next twelve month recent rate ipca evidence inflation persistence may return historical level copom believe additional loosening monetary policy compromise recent success reduce inflation
result copom decide unanimously fix target rate
closing meeting announce copom would meet august technical presentation following day order discuss monetary policy decision establish communiqué october summary data analyze copom
