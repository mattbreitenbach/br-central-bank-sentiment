prospective assessment inflation trend
base newly available information already identify shock impact economy subject review scenario consider simulation exercise base following hypothesis
inflation september slightly expect level subgrouping meal home increase confirm previous analysis shock occur heading would effect rapidly absorb consequently forecast increase one percent food price general fourth quarter maintain
oil market price midst period great volatility already existent worry worsen grow turmoil middle east however notwithstanding slight growth future market price structure future still point succession monthly decline hypothesis additional increase domestic fuel price current year maintain basic scenario
regard government manage price scenario incorporate impact possible rise public transportation rate municipality yet authorize annual increase situation exist case rio de janeiro electricity rate hypothesis point average increase government manage price general direct impact percentage point inflation year insofar concern hypothesis public service rate follow growth pattern estimate general index use respective contract government manage price accompany median increase price economy maintain
despite increased uncertainty regard external environment particularly slowdown united state economy devaluation euro federal fund interest rate trajectory implicit future contract change previous level per year level utilize simulation
hypothesis consider previous meeting maintain particularly respect primary surplus keep target define fiscal policy gdp growth compatible state equilibrium aggregate supply demand
conclusion draw simulation exercise scenario confirm interest current level per year make possible comply inflation target
