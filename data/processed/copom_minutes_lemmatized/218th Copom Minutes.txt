discussion conduct monetary policy
committee member discuss evolution economic activity light available data conclude data indicate continuation recovery economic activity gradual pace envisage early year

member committee also highlight reduction uncertainty domestic front lead decline risk premia embed brazilian asset price decline uncertainty contribute reduce degree asymmetry balance risk inflation despite improvement copom member conclude upward risk inflation continue great weight balance risk
copom analyze inflation trajectory next month trajectory lead rise month inflation reach peak around second quarter thereafter inflation expect decline remainder towards target
regard underlie inflation recent month various measure rise level consider low reach level committee deem appropriate generally consistent inflation target recent change relative price context anchored inflation expectation seem contribute raise inflation level compatible inflation target without pose risk maintenance inflation level relative price adjustment take place however committee member consider evolution prospective inflation path medium long term along anchoring inflation expectation monitor order evaluate possible enduring effect recent shock inflation effect
copom member discuss convenience maintain official document message principle conduct monetary policy face relative price shock inflation target regime anchored expectation copom communicate context monetary policy focus possible effect relative price change induce occasional shock also stress reaction possible change relative price symmetric monetary policy follow principle whether face inflationary shock case shock lead depreciation exchange rate face disinflationary shock case favorable food price shock committee member ponder already clear mechanical relationship shock produce relative price adjustment monetary policy hence agree exclude message next meeting understanding interpret change conduct monetary policy
member committee also discuss extent exchange rate brazilian economy assess exception administered price level contain member ponder however intensity depends several factor level economic slack degree anchoring inflation expectation committee continue monitor different measure exchange rate inflation underlying inflation
copom member assess economic condition anchored inflation expectation underlie inflation measure adequate level inflation projection close target high level slack economy still prescribe accommodative monetary policy interest rate structural interest rate level although estimate rate involve high degree uncertainty committee member express view current real interest rate provide stimulus economy
committee also discuss conditionality would prescribe accommodative monetary policy member agree appropriate level stimulus depends economic condition particular inflation expectation level economic slack balance risk inflation projection importantly provision monetary stimulus require environment anchored inflation expectation committee assess stimulus remove gradually prospective scenario inflation relevant horizon balance risk worsen
copom stress continuation reform necessary adjustment brazilian economy essential reduction structural interest rate committee continue reassess estimate rate time
committee member discuss monetary policy decision light evolution baseline scenario balance risk since september meeting meeting unanimously decide maintain selic rate
copom discuss advisability signal future evolution monetary policy despite reduction degree asymmetry balance risk member consider current environment prescribes retain great flexibility conduct monetary policy require refrain provide indication next step monetary policy member copom reinforce importance emphasize commitment conduct monetary policy order maintain path prospective inflation line inflation target require flexibility gradually adjust conduct monetary policy need ability respond different circumstance contribute maintenance environment anchored expectation fundamental ensure achievement low inflation persists even face adverse shock
committee member reiterate preference communicate conditionality conduct monetary policy well transmit economic rationality guide decision contribute increase transparency enhance copom communication context reassert next step conduct monetary policy continue depend evolution economic activity balance risk inflation projection expectation
committee member emphasize approval implementation reform notably fiscal adjustment brazilian economy crucial sustainability environment low stable inflation full operation monetary policy reduction structural interest rate economy widespread benefit society committee also note perception continuity reform agenda affect expectation current macroeconomic projection
finally copom member stress importance initiative aim productivity increase efficiency gain great flexibility economy improvement business environment effort fundamental resumption economic activity development brazilian economy
