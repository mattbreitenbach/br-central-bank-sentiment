copom emphasize important time lag implementation monetary policy effect economic activity inflation therefore evaluation alternative option monetary policy necessarily focus inflation scenario risk instead current inflation index viewpoint even important period high uncertainty
prospect evolution economic activity deteriorate since last copom meeting particular effect international crisis domestic financial condition indicate contribution credit support domestic demand may decline intensively possibly persistently magnitude would happen exclusively monetary policy lag effect additionally intensification international crisis cause negative effect consumer business confidence situation persist strength economic activity would increasingly depend real payroll expansion effect governmental transfer expect next quarter consideration become even relevant consider fact monetary policy decision concentrate impact
