copom member discuss evolution domestic economic activity light available information indicator evaluate recent data suggest partial recovery economic activity government transfer program allow relatively strong rebound durable good consumption investment however several service sector activity especially directly affect social distancing measure remain significantly depress look forward poor predictability associate evolution pandemic necessary decline emergency aid end increase uncertainty speed economic recovery committee consider unpredictability risk associate evolution pandemic may imply domestic scenario characterize even gradual recovery economy
copom member debate level economic slack activity committee believe pandemic continue heterogeneous effect economic sector give nature shock service sector continue large economic slack sector committee conclude nature crisis probably imply disinflationary pressure reduce demand may last long previous recession
committee resume discussion potential effective low limit brazilian policy interest rate connection prudential financial stability issue majority member copom limit would significantly high among emerge economy among developed country due existence risk premium premium dynamic tend large brazil give country relative fiscal fragility uncertainty regard prospective fiscal path context would already close level interest rate reduction could accompany asset price instability
copom also discuss relative importance main component credit operating cost financial system consider long history brazilian economy operate reference interest rate high level unprecedented low interest rate may compromise performance market economic sector potential impact financial intermediation base result stress test scenario committee conclude financial system resilient credit risk arise current pandemic however analyze financial system broad way consider various industry market product financial service committee reflect unprecedented low interest rate environment may increase asset price volatility moreover without necessary time transition new environment may affect proper functioning dynamic financial system capital market hence committee conclude possible new interest rate reduction would demand caution additional gradualism end necessary interest rate cut would require great clarity prospective inflation activity could space time
order raise degree monetary stimulus provide traditional instrument maintain necessary caution prudential reason since meeting copom adopt forward guidance additional monetary policy instrument
adapt forward guidance dynamic limit impose prudential issue committee consider asymmetric policy intention necessary condition meet copom would raise interest rate could reduce maximize effectiveness committee decide forward guidance conditional inflation expectation well inflation projection baseline scenario relevant monetary policy horizon currently include less extent information inflation would consider altogether sufficiently close inflation target corresponding horizon would indicate end intention
give difficulty inherent use forward guidance emerge economy addition expectation projection inflation relevant horizon committee also deem necessary condition interest rate policy intention two factor first conditional maintenance fiscal regime since rupture would imply significant change structural interest rate economy second conditional anchoring inflation expectation give unanchoring would indicate cost derive monetary stimulus would outweigh benefit
finally copom judge condition maintenance forward guidance continue meet committee considers inflation expectation well inflation projection baseline scenario significantly inflation target relevant monetary policy horizon current fiscal regime change inflation expectation remain well anchor
monetary policy decision
take account baseline scenario balance risk broad array available information copom unanimously decide maintain selic rate committee judge decision reflect baseline scenario prospective inflation variance balance risk consistent convergence inflation target relevant horizon monetary policy include less extent
committee believe persevere process reform necessary adjustment brazilian economy essential sustainable economic recovery copom also stress doubt regard continuation reform agenda permanent change fiscal consolidation process could result increase structural interest rate
copom believe current economic condition continue recommend unusually strong monetary stimulus recognize due prudential financial stability reason remain space monetary policy stimulus exist small consequently possible future adjustment current degree monetary stimulus would occur additional gradualism would depend perception fiscal trajectory well new information change committee current assessment prospective inflation
provide monetary stimulus deem adequate meet inflation target maintain necessary caution prudential reason copom consider appropriate continue adopt forward guidance additional monetary policy tool therefore despite asymmetry balance risk copom intend reduce monetary stimulus unless inflation expectation well baseline scenario inflation projection sufficiently close inflation target relevant horizon monetary policy currently include less extent intention conditional maintenance current fiscal regime anchoring inflation expectation
