installed capacity utilization manufacturing industry reach november october accord cni data seasonally adjust bcb consider adjust data average installed capacity utilization november stand period last year since july utilization rate high level observe month disaggregated indicator compile fgv show utilization rate historically high level civil construction capital good whose production vigorously expand despite industrial production growth average utilization show relative stability reflect improvement productive capacity fact recent data regard output absorption capital good suggest robust ongoing expansion investment year november absorption capital good expand mainly drive increase capital good import volume capital good production civil construction input expand accord comparison basis therefore despite ongoing aggregate demand expansion relevant aggregate supply imbalance could jeopardy inflation target anticipate come quarter stress previous copom minute inflation trajectory closely link current prospective development regard expansion supply adequately meet demand condition
trade balance continue present robust result confirm previous copom assessment regard important structural change brazilian external trade trade balance reach u billion level reach result drive record result export u billion import u billion despite significant trailing surplus december low u billion record high observe october result domestic demand recovery import outperform margin gradually compress trade balance result consequence external result expect low observe still high brazilian historical standard current account surplus stand u billion november reach u billion year gdp u billion surplus twelve month november gdp
regard international scenario uncertainty regard monetary policy stance u persist although additional interest rate increase discard consensus point fact tightening cycle may already end hand even though recession scenario u economy seem less plausible uncertainty magnitude u economy deceleration uncertainty regard monetary policy europe japan also persist however bear emphasize far limited effect less clear international outlook observe last month concern state already present particularly regard increase risk aversion commodity price trajectory low international liquidity fact may sovereign risk reach historically low level last month fact corroborate recurrent analysis express previous press release inflation report brazilian economy resilient external shock context copom reaffirm continued disinflation robust persistent trade surplus adequate public sector primary surplus buildup international reserve improve public sector debt profile buyback external debt strengthen domestic resilience external shock therefore copom continue assign low probability significant deterioration international financial market condition could affect brazilian external financing
another concern regard international outlook oil price continue dampen oil price slightly decrease since last copom meeting contribute cool uncertainty associate evolution effect world economy oil price low price observe last month due exceptionally mild winter northern hemisphere apparent difficulty opec face control supply spite recent decrease oil price still present high volatility reflect among factor geopolitical tension weather condition however scenario consider copom attribute change domestic gasoline price become likely occur risk relate materialization decrease significantly despite stability domestic gasoline price change international oil price affect domestic oil price instance productive chain petrochemical well deterioration market inflation expectation
assessment inflation trend
identified shock impact reassess accord newly available information scenario consider simulation utilize following assumption compare value consider december inflation report projection gasoline bottle gas price adjustment change consider comparison basis projection household electricity fix telephone price adjustment change respectively projection regulated price inflation decrease december inflation report item accord weight release ibge represent total december ipca projection regulated price inflation maintain present december inflation report projection regulated price base endogenous determination model model consider effect seasonal component exchange rate change market price inflation igp projection spread selic rate use vector autoregressive model base selic swap rate eve meeting stand fourth quarter reach last quarter
regard fiscal policy assume consolidated public sector primary surplus target gdp achieve adjust possibility reduction percentage due implementation ppi investment pilot plan related assumption consider previous meeting maintain
since november copom meeting median ipca inflation expectation compile bcb investor relation group gerin decrease slightly decrease mainly drive low inflation project second third quarter year ahead inflation expectation decrease inflation expectation decrease mention previous minute development suggest consolidation favorable macroeconomic scenario
inflation forecast benchmark scenario assume maintenance selic rate exchange rate forecast period decrease compare value consider november copom meeting remain target establish cmn year forecast base market scenario incorporate consensus exchange selic rate trajectory collect gerin eve copom meeting also remain value consider november copom meeting central target year projection accord scenario reduce relative november projection remain target benchmark scenario target market scenario
monetary policy decision
copom reaffirm view express previous minute besides contain inflationary pressure monetary policy also contribute significantly consolidation favorable term macroeconomic environment economic activity data still suggest high likelihood important pressure inflation import expansion contribute significantly process complement domestic production therefore limit potential inflationary effect aggregate demand sustain growth addition despite prospect low liquidity international market due interest rate increase industrialized economy external outlook particularly regard brazilian external financing remain favorable even context moderation international growth favorable external outlook strengthen international oil price decrease significantly last week therefore prospect inflation trajectory remain benign november meeting copom emphasize main challenge monetary policy context guarantee consolidation future positive development
copom evaluate pressure stem food regulate price mainly public transportation fare state capital drive inflation increase since effect exhaust yet upcoming inflation indicator likely reflect increase due nature pressure expect temporary decrease intensity throughout time without necessarily affect horizon however copom continue manage monetary policy stance gain obtain inflation control recent year become permanent respect copom carefully monitor evolution inflation several core inflation measure upcoming month discriminate persistent generalized price increase promptly adjust monetary policy stance circumstance
preservation inflation rate line target path consolidation stable macroeconomic scenario contribute progressive reduction macroeconomic risk perception underway scope reduction real interest rate future naturally follow consequence improved perception copom evaluate cautious monetary policy stance critical increase probability inflation convergence target path materialize however important look inflation indicator remain consistent recent benign inflation outlook observe last quarter
copom emphasize important time lag transmission monetary policy stance economic activity inflation since beginning monetary easing cycle september selic rate already reduce great part reduction concentrate second half consequently activity level completely mirror effect interest rate cut well effect economic activity resumption inflation completely materialize therefore evaluation alternative monetary policy stance necessarily focus prospective inflation scenario risk instead current inflation indicator
coming month employment income expansion credit growth continue bolster economic activity mention november copom minute activity level also reflect effect governmental transfer fiscal impulse occur expect year consequently lagged effect interest rate cut increasingly robust aggregate demand add factor continue contribute expansion
give reason state copom consider three previous meeting convenience reduce selic target basis point copom member consensually conclude several factor would justify decision would contribute increase total adjustment implement however consensus low pace monetary easing start present meeting three member committee vote reduction selic target consider current balance risk justify decision
hand majority member copom emphasize information available moment justify change pace ongoing monetary ease process give exist incentive expand aggregate demand uncertainty surround monetary policy transmission mechanism low distance current selic rate equilibrium interest rate interest rate cut implement since september copom member understand preservation important achievement disinflation preserve economic growth job creation rise real income demand cautious monetary ease stance argument even relevant consider sign heated aggregate demand inflation pressure fact monetary policy decision concentrate effect second half progressively
therefore copom decide reduce selic target basis point without bias five vote copom monetary policy action three vote favor reduce selic target basis point
regime monetary authority decide accord inflation prospect analyze alternative scenario main variable determine price dynamic international scenario remain favorable new element uncertainty come hand set price pressure apparently temporary arise domestic demand already expand robustly environment monetary authority must remain vigilant uncertainty contaminate long time horizon evidently case exacerbation risk factor monitor copom monetary policy strategy promptly adapt circumstance
conclusion meeting announce copom would reconvene march technical presentation following day discuss monetary policy decision establish communiqué october summary data analyze copom inflation
