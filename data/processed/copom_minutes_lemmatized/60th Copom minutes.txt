prospective assessment inflation
identify shock impact reassess light newly available information scenario consider simulation base following hypothesis
may inflation rate line expectation
international price oil decline last day albeit daily price exhibit high volatility consider price schedule imply brent crude oil future contract average year assume around u per barrel
projection electricity price increase change consider adjustment already authorize area cover ipca adjustment public transportation also reassess take account increase bus fare expectation set government manage price include fuel energy public transportation telecommunication total expect adjustment represent direct contribution percentage point year inflation
reduction agricultural price may indicate price index confirm ipca increase food beverage price reach year ipca whole rise therefore hypothesis evolution food price change incorporate deflationary pressure june follow average price remaining year
inclusion term structure domestic interest rate inflation forecast model specify june inflation report demand specification hypothesis slope assumption slope interest rate curve would remain positive smoothly decline time end
hypothesis path fed fund rate line path rate indicate future contract reduction current level per year third quarter year stability thereafter
external scenario persistence uncertainty assume maintain brazil risk premium stable next quarter
regard electricity shock result yet preliminary modeling effort point reduction economic growth rate year net effect inflation contrary tend minor especially compare effect shock government manage price
ipca inflation core calculate symmetric method rise may mainly due food price april item exclude upper tail distribution belong food group present high rate contribute core value may ipca capture price deceleration item whose fall complete june thus item include core raise last twelve month core inflation reach evaluation ipca exclusion core rate lead conclusion exclude influence managed food price month variation ipca remain around inflation core release fundação getúlio vargas fell april may accumulation twelve month
median market expectation ipca inflation survey central bank daily basis present following evolution revise upwards
remain assumption establish previous meeting kept unchanged particular achievement primary fiscal surplus accord fiscal policy target
simulation exercise scenario consider basic structural model lead conclusion preservation interest rate current level per year would result inflation near upper limit target however project inflation target
monetary policy guideline
economic activity continue grow robustly first quarter follow apparent moderation beginning substantial drop end second quarter industry lead expansion growth capital good production suggest increase investment rate marginal deceleration confirm consumption indicator april may reduced demand credit
reduction energy consumption well assimilate society although implication may differ individual consumer activity sector energy crisis also different effect macroeconomic variable doubt negative effect output growth year magnitude impact difficult quantify hand grow consensus net impact inflation tends low another important consequence energy crisis alter expectation due contribution domestic political instability
besides domestic uncertainty external scenario remain troublesome global economy still show sign recovery growth united state euro zone economy still lack strength japan remain stagnant oil price remain high despite recent fall therefore despite resultant slackening monetary policy economy environment risk aversion remain
argentina situation improve since last meeting country complete important lengthening part public debt make room advance economic stimulus fiscal reform program return economic normalcy however depend confirmation improve fiscal outlook consistent sign economic recovery take time
exchange rate deserve detailed discussion first month year part gradual depreciation exchange rate could explain perception deterioration balance payment domestic external uncertainty worsen uncertainty period strong repercussion brazil risk perception lift cost raise capital abroad moreover balance payment performance particularly favorable negative outcome trade balance reflect strength domestic demand opposition global economic deceleration suggest import would remain strong export would face foreign demand constraint result expected magnitude current account deficit rise expected flow foreign direct investment decline therefore natural expect foreign exchange market would seek new equilibrium
potential pas exchange rate depreciation price one reason reaction monetary policy period increase interest rate attempt neutralize effect inflation expectation although revise upward accompany pace depreciation indicate part latter perceive permanent therefore transmit final price however total impact pas depreciation price also include effect adjustment tariff manage price especially gasoline general context exchange rate depreciation estimate contribute least percentage point expect inflation year
recently however dynamic observe foreign exchange market change last week domestic price dollar rise considerably despite fact period forecast economic impact energy crisis become less pessimistic improvement external scenario basic interest rate fell united state europe argentina successfully complete debt swap operation pricing process foreign exchange market seem present new dynamic decouple usual fundamental determinant dollar price rise simply grow number market participant believe since rise past also rise future therefore otherwise would purchase foreign currency future prefer right away whatever current price might since believe procrastination may costly although process exchange rate depreciation sustainable medium run may nefarious consequence economy last distort consumption investment decision affect corporate balance sheet change relative price threaten inflation target
copom determine measure implement price formation exchange market cease present characteristic speculative bubble measure include elevation cost maintain speculative position adoption disposition irrigate market additional resource stem reinforcement financing balance payment order provide adequate liquidity price formation avoid anticipation future demand defensive precautionary reason action back implementation important structural measure banking taxation
inflation measure broad consumer price index ipca accumulate percentage point may figure expectation result increase food price first five month year surprise consider arrival agricultural crop ii increase price percentage point model projection iii partial pas exchange rate depreciation moreover core inflation measure remain high manage price expect increase average copom consider prospect inflation considerably represent substantial risk accomplishment target hand path inflation absence spiral exchange rate depreciation present consistent target
sum copom conclude persistence exist pressure inflation potential effect unstable process exchange rate depreciation recommend reinforcement monetary policy significant elevation interest rate realign path expect inflation establish target two proposal consider increase interest rate upper bound market expectation large increase simultaneous indication downward bias second alternative choose although complex indicate clearly proactive approach seek reversion present situation downward bias introduce understanding measure announce might contribute rapid reversion inflation expectation
accordingly copom unanimously decide increase selic rate target per year indicate downward bias
close meeting announce committee would meet july pm technical presentation following day pm order discuss monetary policy guideline set calendar copom ordinary meeting publish central bank communiqué
