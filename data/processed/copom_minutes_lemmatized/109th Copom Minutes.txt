monetary policy decision
reach april high level since july third consecutive monthly increase ipca inflation fell may sharp reduction since october drop ipca inflation owe large part slower regulated price inflation despite pressure rise electricity rate regulate price whole register small increase due decline fuel price occur despite acceleration clothing price

international financial market remain volatile improvement scenario consider last copom meeting rise steadily earlier year u treasury yield particularly note hit low see since april prior beginning monetary tightening cycle also appear least partial absorption shock relate deterioration corporate credit quality brazil development accompany decline brazilian country risk currency appreciation nevertheless liquidity condition market stability remain tie macroeconomic condition industrialized country especially united state feed potential monetary policy response economic development additional point concern current account imbalance large economy possibility eventual adjustment result significant currency movement despite concern significant degree uncertainty copom continue assign low probability significant deterioration international financial market
oil price continue fluctuate significantly reach record high april oil price decline rise recent week increase level volatility oil price occur response new information demand condition potential supply restriction among producer country inventory data main consumer country oil price projection remain subject considerable degree uncertainty particularly regard scope persistence recent price behavior copom therefore maintain baseline scenario assume adjustment domestic fuel price nevertheless recent increase international oil price translate increase domestic gasoline price international oil price trend continue represent risk future inflation path via effect price product well private sector inflation expectation copom view path oil price represent significant risk future inflation trajectory may
since last copom meeting median ipca inflation expectation collect gerin decline inflation expectation year appear responsive favorable development reduce inflationary pressure sign accommodation economic growth reevaluation market expectation exchange rate path restrictive monetary stance ahead inflation expectation also decline recent week fast pace expectation expectation remain stable development suggest monetary policy stance contain inflationary pressure contribute consolidation favorable macroeconomic environment
inflation forecast benchmark scenario assume maintenance selic rate exchange rate forecast period decline relative may meeting forecast remain inflation objective year decline due mainly change inflation expectation may inflation updating output gap estimate first quarter gdp data forecast base market scenario incorporate consensus exchange rate selic rate trajectory eve copom meeting benchmark scenario also may reason cite benchmark scenario inflation forecast remain constant level central target establish national monetary council market scenario modest reduction projection nevertheless remain central target
copom also analyze inflation forecast period end march june september forecast period responsive current monetary policy decision calendar year also reliable calendar year forecast benchmark scenario twelve month end march value interpolate inflation objective target nevertheless forecast forecast period make may copom meeting forecast benchmark scenario twelve month end june september inflation target path period
copom reaffirm view express prior copom minute effect interest rate tighten cycle begin september reflect inflation result inflation forecast economic activity continue expand slow pace line supply condition exert significant inflationary pressure addition copom estimate easing specific pressure point current inflation improvement external environment despite recent uptick international oil price therefore risk convergence inflation target path decline relative prevail time may copom meeting
copom assess maintain interest rate level establish may sufficiently long period time would create condition necessary assure inflation convergence target path make unnecessary continue interest rate adjustment cycle copom therefore unanimously decide maintain selic target unchanged without bias clearly exacerbation risk inflation outlook monitor committee monetary stance quickly adapt circumstance
