monetary policy decision
reach april high level since july third consecutive monthly increase ipca inflation fell may sharp reduction since october drop ipca inflation owe large part slower regulated price inflation despite pressure rise electricity rate regulate price whole register small increase due decline fuel price occur despite acceleration clothing price
ipca core inflation decelerate may measure monitor copom exclusion trim mean smooth deceleration core exclusion household food item regulate price present large change april among three measure reflect deceleration market price inflation tradable good trimmed mean core inflation decelerate line broad deceleration index turn smooth trim mean core inflation slow least reflect implicit inertial component core measure post high accumulated inflation last twelve month despite deceleration ipca core yet reach level compatible inflation target path
inflation fell may continue strong deceleration register april driven largely sharp decline wholesale component fell rise april reflect part drop agricultural price reverse strong agricultural price increase register february march due drought southern brazil addition contrary prior month industrial ipa also negative may data first ten day june suggest stable agricultural price period strong reduction industrial price overall evidence consistent accommodation wholesale price emphasize prior copom minute stable industrial ipa recent month reflect part exchange rate appreciation effect monetary tightening could positive spillover future performance consumer price strength depend prospective demand condition expectation future inflation path
gdp grow first quarter seasonally adjust term confirm accommodation economic growth nevertheless complete eighth consecutive quarter growth accommodation observe since last quarter follow period accelerated economic growth record level economic activity attain growth first quarter drive agricultural sector register seasonally adjust expansion manufacturing service fell respectively accommodation pace growth visible component domestic demand gross fixed capital formation contract second consecutive quarterly decline five quarter uninterrupted strong growth since household consumption fell grow steadily throughout export good service grow import grow term confirm increase period relative importance external demand factor sustain economic growth consider behavior lead economic activity indicator progressive consolidation monetary adjustment process implement since september growth expect accelerate come quarter
industrial production stable april seasonally adjust term near historical high reach december stability april follow seasonally adjusted growth march could reflect correction inherent fluctuation series due seasonal adjustment move holiday timing easter moving average series remain steady april elevated level observe since may lead coincident indicator suggest continue stability industrial production
intermediate good industrial category register output growth april decline production consumer good durables well capital good production also decline rise sharply march moving average however suggest consumer durable good production continue grow level close register recent month consumer good production decline also decline production capital good finally intermediate good break downward trend register since september continuation april trend would suggest change pattern previous two month item like consumer durables post robust growth item lose dynamism data necessary well characterize potential change pattern industrial activity
recent labor market data remain favorable ibge survey show unemployment rate hold steady april unlike pattern observe increase unemployment rate addition first four month unemployment rate period number employed worker rise versus march reduction real payroll average earnings manufacture employment measure national industry confederation cni seasonally adjust bcb continue increase since first quarter real manufacturing payroll somewhat uneven fall beginning year rise march fall april formal employment measure ministry labor employment mte continue expand creation job april high value month since creation series result new formal sector job create first four month

emphasize prior copom minute despite recent modest decline capacity utilization measure cni data seasonally adjust bcb remain historic high inflation path remain largely tie current prospective supply increase adequately meet demand condition vein capital good production accumulate growth twelve month end april capital good absorption rise first four month year slow growth register margin reflect sharp drop agricultural machinery investment considerably high comparison base due strong investment expansion high pace since appear likely recent accommodation pace investment growth persist key concern regard prospective inflation dynamic continue performance aggregate supply come quarter
strong trade surplus robust export import growth continue may reinforce favorable outlook year twelve month may export grow value term relative period last year import grow reflect part high oil price import exclude oil rise roughly export grow fast pace import trade balance rise u billion twelve month may represent increase twelve month may strong trade balance result contribute accumulated current account surplus u billion twelve month may equivalent gdp expansion external trade register recent month also accompany export diversification term product destination
international financial market remain volatile improvement scenario consider last copom meeting rise steadily earlier year u treasury yield particularly note hit low see since april prior beginning monetary tightening cycle also appear least partial absorption shock relate deterioration corporate credit quality brazil development accompany decline brazilian country risk currency appreciation nevertheless liquidity condition market stability remain tie macroeconomic condition industrialized country especially united state feed potential monetary policy response economic development additional point concern current account imbalance large economy possibility eventual adjustment result significant currency movement despite concern significant degree uncertainty copom continue assign low probability significant deterioration international financial market
oil price continue fluctuate significantly reach record high april oil price decline rise recent week increase level volatility oil price occur response new information demand condition potential supply restriction among producer country inventory data main consumer country oil price projection remain subject considerable degree uncertainty particularly regard scope persistence recent price behavior copom therefore maintain baseline scenario assume adjustment domestic fuel price nevertheless recent increase international oil price translate increase domestic gasoline price international oil price trend continue represent risk future inflation path via effect price product well private sector inflation expectation copom view path oil price represent significant risk future inflation trajectory may
since last copom meeting median ipca inflation expectation collect gerin decline inflation expectation year appear responsive favorable development reduce inflationary pressure sign accommodation economic growth reevaluation market expectation exchange rate path restrictive monetary stance ahead inflation expectation also decline recent week fast pace expectation expectation remain stable development suggest monetary policy stance contain inflationary pressure contribute consolidation favorable macroeconomic environment
inflation forecast benchmark scenario assume maintenance selic rate exchange rate forecast period decline relative may meeting forecast remain inflation objective year decline due mainly change inflation expectation may inflation updating output gap estimate first quarter gdp data forecast base market scenario incorporate consensus exchange rate selic rate trajectory eve copom meeting benchmark scenario also may reason cite benchmark scenario inflation forecast remain constant level central target establish national monetary council market scenario modest reduction projection nevertheless remain central target
copom also analyze inflation forecast period end march june september forecast period responsive current monetary policy decision calendar year also reliable calendar year forecast benchmark scenario twelve month end march value interpolate inflation objective target nevertheless forecast forecast period make may copom meeting forecast benchmark scenario twelve month end june september inflation target path period
copom reaffirm view express prior copom minute effect interest rate tighten cycle begin september reflect inflation result inflation forecast economic activity continue expand slow pace line supply condition exert significant inflationary pressure addition copom estimate easing specific pressure point current inflation improvement external environment despite recent uptick international oil price therefore risk convergence inflation target path decline relative prevail time may copom meeting
copom assess maintain interest rate level establish may sufficiently long period time would create condition necessary assure inflation convergence target path make unnecessary continue interest rate adjustment cycle copom therefore unanimously decide maintain selic target unchanged without bias clearly exacerbation risk inflation outlook monitor committee monetary stance quickly adapt circumstance
conclusion meeting announce copom would reconvene july technical presentation following day discuss monetary policy decision establish communiqué october summary data analyze copom
