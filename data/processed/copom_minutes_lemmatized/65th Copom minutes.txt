assessment inflation trend
identified shock impact reassess light newly available information scenario consider simulation consider following hypothesis
october inflation rate measure ipca reach expected result
forecast price product calculate base term structure price imply brent crude oil future contract expectation trajectory average price data brent barrel substantially reduce u last quarter reach u end trend project reduction fuel price consumer
wider set contractual price expected readjustment increase november october expected readjustment
forecast readjustment electricity tariff remain approximately high readjustment expect may reach
project slope domestic yield curve measure difference term di rate selic rate significantly reduce average basis point fourth quarter linearly decline average first quarter remain stable end year
path fed fund rate project base maturity future contract alter reflect average rate fourth quarter decline first quarter show moderate increase thereafter
external front assumption average risk premium use brazil global bond incorporate decline path current level plateau near second quarter stability thereafter
core inflation ipca calculate symmetric method remain stable october accumulate month core index increase core inflation calculate symmetric trim rise october accumulate month core increase inflation core calculate exclusion contractual price consider wide set weigh ipca october household food price increase october accumulated variation month
ipca increase october reflect contribution contractual price variation free price variation remainder year contribution expect contractual price variation evolution contractual price expect directly contribute year inflation compare estimate october contractual price expect increase direct contribution exclude effect inflation influence hike electricity residential consumer
regard fiscal policy assume primary surplus target consolidated public sector state government economic program achieve remain assumption make previous meeting maintain
simulation exercise several specification structural model lead conclusion maintenance interest rate current level exchange rate plateau eve copom meeting would result inflation upper limit target project inflation around
monetary policy guideline
positive expectation regard brazil economic performance contribute appreciation real well reduction brazil risk real significantly appreciate since last copom meeting change eve meeting brazil risk premium measure yield differential global treasury bond equivalent duration also improve may observe drop high bps period therefore upward trend observe reverse become important compare increase risk emerge country specially argentina particularly expectation reduction current account deficit improvement country external financing support monetary exchange policy adjustment contribute appreciation real well reduction brazil risk
improvement also follow significant reduction international price brent crude oil u u since last meeting besides direct benefit drop international crude oil price inflation still indirect benefit cause low pressure exchange rate market give weight item import
expectation regard economic growth also improve sign smooth reversion cool trend follow effect shock hit economy deceleration world economy argentine crisis september attack energy rationing addition effect restrictive domestic monetary policy march reversion yet incipient observe increase retail commerce são paulo number request credit protection service spc consumer intention index well stability observe industrial activity
reduction slope term interest rate come along low exchange rate pressure drop brazil risk slope fell around bps eve last copom meeting average bps third quarter
despite favorable performance economy correspondent improvement prospect inflation median expectation ipca variation consider sample comprise aggregate survey financial institution collect daily central bank show increase
several factor might contribute worsening inflation forecast firstly ipca october register increase high expect reflect high passthrough exchange rate depreciation occur year price increase inflation tends fee expected inflation inertial component indeed indicator core inflation calculate symmetric average method remain high plateau
secondly low slope term structure interest rate also contribute demand recovery could lead large pressure price effect may attenuate downward impact recent appreciation real upon inflation
finally perspective regard readjustment contractual price next year remain high particularly increase electricity price may reach besides reduction subsidy cooking gas price consider imply price increase increase mean important supply shock economy general term behavior contractual price directly contribute inflation least even exclude effect increase inflation
summary improvement several brazilian economic indicator accompany improvement inflation forecast despite favorable effect exchange rate appreciation drop international oil price hike contractual price expect represent supply shock add secondary impact shock occur year price impose narrow limit free price inflation indicator next year context incipient recovery demand might stimulate low slope interest rate curve improvement expectation general must monitor avoid passthrough shock inflation
accordingly copom unanimously decide maintain target selic rate
close meeting announce committee would meet december technical presentation following day order discuss monetary policy guideline set calendar copom ordinary meeting publish central bank communiqué
