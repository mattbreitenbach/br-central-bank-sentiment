monetary policy decision
three consecutive month increase inflation register ipca decrease february january result significant decrease inflation tradable regulated item fell respectively inflation tradable item rise almost period reach february strongly influence increase school fee item exclude item inflation would would represent fall compare january inflation measure consumer price index show decrease respectively compare january however general price index show mixed evidence decrease increase increase mainly cause high inflation wholesale industrial price reach february value register january
fall consumer inflation february clearly see behavior core inflation calculate method core inflation calculate smoothing item method decrease low figure record since june core inflation calculate without smoothing procedure decrease core inflation calculate exclude household food item regulate price rise however occur item group increase due school fee behavior item exclude core inflation calculate exclude household food item regulate price would decrease february good behavior consumer inflation also see drop core ratio item ipca positive variation month decrease average observe last three quarter
accord ibge gdp fell relation despite fact gdp growth stand expect output performance remain qualitatively consistent benchmark scenario copom work especially regard economic cycle specifically second semester economy begin recovery process post growth last quarter year compare previous quarter equivalent annual rate economic indicator available far suggest sustained economic growth path beginning year due significant growth last quarter likely gdp data first quarter indicate cool economic activity
industrial production keep recovery trend present growth january compare december accord ibge seasonally adjust data semi good output present growth first time since last september suggest growth record sector economy influence sector present recovery far marginal increase employment real earnings quarterly move average behavior present continuous industrial output growth although low rate one record last quarter february consider previous indicator possible discard fall industrial production perfectly compatible usual pattern sustained growth recovery oscillation around trend moreover february eighteen work day twenty work day month harm comparison month addition two five last year carnival march may affect seasonal adjustment series industrial production benefit low inventory level compensate negative scenario consider different source provide data industrial sale industrial production fourth consecutive month former record high growth latter january accord national confederation industry cni fact may give additional stimulus production associate inventory dynamic
accord ibge data seasonally adjust bcb retail sale fell november december yet retail sale são paulo grow january relation previous month accord fecomercio data seasonally adjust bcb consider behavior new credit concession likely data period show decrease consumption durable good automobile furniture domestic appliance march consumer intention index iic stand critic value signal positive perspective however fall relation february suggests low consumption growth follow growth real income observe last month supermarket sale concentrate good present progressive recovery
consolidation positive data economic activity continue follow expressive indicator external sector post favorable combination economic policy result see brazil several year february trade balance surplus reach u billion u billion surplus forecast satisfactory result consider expected economic growth year compare period last year february export import grow respectively due favorable performance trade balance current account result present surplus february accumulate u billion despite excellent result external account increase sovereign risk perception measure brazil increase value around february march eves copom meeting increase almost january february spite reduction private external funding dollar remain stable value around eve copom meeting regardless high volatility observe last two month copom maintain evaluation external scenario favorable present perspective world economic growth high international liquidity
three consecutive month deterioration inflation expectation first quarter drop accord survey conduct investor relation group gerin inflation february bellow expect eve previous copom meeting median march inflation expectation also drop eve february meeting march meeting full sample institution participate survey institution accurate forecast short run top forecasting institution hence full sample expectation first quarter fell top forecasting institution fell median market expectation remain stable respectively expectation next month decrease period
accord benchmark scenario consider bcb inflation forecast assume maintenance rate foreign exchange rate project inflation target accordance market scenario include market expect path exchange rate selic rate eve copom meeting bcb inflation forecast lie target compare february increase projection scenario february inflation forecast much effective one even though consider gdp growth fourth quarter effective regulated price variation great expect copom revise downwards since meeting february inflation expectation high one currently verify
previous meeting copom also examine projection produce accord methodology accord benchmark market scenario interest exchange rate path take account top inflation expectation march hence project inflation following month exercise consider benchmark scenario project inflation slightly target bellow target however project inflation february result exercise due substitution low figure effectively observe expected inflation top forecaster month february reduction expect inflation institution march reason mention paragraph regard gdp performance reduction projection regulated price downwards improvement inflation expectation accord methodology project inflation market scenario target although low one project february due reason mention
copom also evaluate third set scenario suppose low inflation persistence scenario consider hypothesis part high inflation first quarter year impact following quarter could even reversion inflation increase occur period due momentary unfavorable weather condition hypothesis become likely efficient monetary policy exercise coordinating role prevent punctual inflation increase cause supply shock seasonal factor attempt restore margin contaminate inflation expectation hypothesis copom consider part inflation first quarter due seasonal shock shock fashion also affect inflation quarter year magnitude quarterly typical shock estimate reproduce copom projection model seasonal standard observe recent series free price exercise describe previous paragraph inflation first quarter one expect top institution accord procedure consider benchmark scenario exchange interest rate trajectory forecast inflation target market expect exchange interest rate consider inflation remains target although closer target value exercise encompass expectation top institution first quarter inflation remains unchanged
copom member evaluate risk fulfil inflation target reduce since last meeting due ipca result core february low inflation expectation short run next twelve month moreover consensual evaluation favorable scenario result recent monetary policy decision mitigate rise industrial cost retail cost second order effect inflationary surprise january february conduction monetary policy beginning year decisive revert environment lead sector economic rebound could pressure price upward expect demand condition would absorb increase therefore risk high inflation diminish risk unsustained economic activity remain low
also consensual interpretation main risk consumer inflation next month consist contamination increase wholesale industrial price retail price important notice element incorporate projected scenario analyze except limited effect result ipca first quarter since perceptible signal transmission channel market expectation ipca next quarter experience last year suggest industrial ipa influence part ipca represent industrialized product usually fast sense recent result deceleration consumer price quite encouraging despite acceleration wholesale price usual high speed enables foresee remain uncertainty increase consumer price result pressure cause wholesale price soon solve
great part increase wholesale price last month explain supply shock among different impact cause cofins ratio levy throughout productive chain increase international price commodity intermediate input still element allow satisfactorily accurate measure magnitude potential impact shock consumer price although preliminary indication example effect cofins may small economic theory best monetary policy practice recommend partial accommodation increase consumer price cause supply shock copom adopt procedure recent past announce revision objective seek year establish adjust target inflation however automatic procedure adopt circumstance optimum degree accommodation may depend factor stage economic cycle economy find unique demand condition among sector differently affect shock distance current inflation desirable inflation medium long term direct response private agent inflation expectation shock copom understand current circumstance recommend adoption procedure willing accommodate recent supply shock
three member copom consider appropriate keep unchanged basic selic rate meeting member recommend great caution conduct monetary policy short term propose eventual cut target rate leave subsequent moment may additional evidence high inflation rate january february might contaminate inflation following month impact recent increase wholesale price future dynamic consumer price may significant caution would increase probability steady anchorage inflationary expectation behavior consolidate favorable level inflation one consider scenario low inflation persistence analyze copom therefore three member vote maintenance target rate
however part member copom immediate fall rate justify recent behavior price index low inflation expectation next twelve month low intensity wholesale retail price consideration indicate maintenance rate january february enough increase probability materialization low inflationary persistence scenario consider committee move away danger inflation increase record december february could contaminate inflation expectation provoke change inflationary dynamic therefore easing monetary policy reflect necessary caution administration risk inflation continuity restore economic activity
result committee decide six vote three reduce target rate
