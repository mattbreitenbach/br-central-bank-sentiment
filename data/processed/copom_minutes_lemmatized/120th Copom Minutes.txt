installed capacity utilization manufacturing industry increase second consecutive month may april accord cni data seasonally adjust bcb year may average installed capacity utilization stand level register period decline partially reflect improvement productive capacity fact recent data regard output absorption capital good civil construction input suggest expansion investment year may capital good absorption expand compare period main contributor result increase capital good import volume capital good production civil construction input expand accord comparison basis therefore despite favorable prospect aggregate demand expansion come quarter relevant supply unbalance anticipate stress previous minute inflation trend closely link current prospective development regard expansion supply adequately meet demand condition
trade balance continue present robust result confirm previous copom assessment regard important structural change brazilian external trade first half trade balance reach billion virtually unchanged compare period last year june trailing surplus reach u billion slightly previous month u billion record high reach march process already expect suggest start adjustment dynamic trade flow even trailing export reach u billion june new record high series similarly import also continue outperform reach u billion june accord comparison basis consequence robust external result expect current account surplus stand u million june u billion surplus twelve month june gdp
uncertainty regard length monetary policy tighten cycle u persist circumstance although accommodation occur last week international market still subject abrupt change consequence composition portfolio recently move heighten due increase geopolitical tension instability reflect price several currency u dollar risk premium several emerge country brazil first fourth week may exchange rate increase country risk measure jp morgan increase since exchange rate country risk swing around respectively accord copom instability observe since start may represent crisis due temporary cause solid domestic macroeconomic fundamental continued disinflation robust persistent trade surplus accumulation international reserve adequate public sector primary surplus improve public sector debt profile buyback external debt strengthen domestic resilience shock improvement domestic resilience shock reflect evidence domestic economy sustain growth trend despite long monetary adjustment process course u therefore copom continue assign low probability significant deterioration international financial market condition could affect brazilian external financing
another concern regard international scenario oil price lately reach record high trend sideways elevated level recent hike reinforce concern oil price may resist level previously expect previous month future oil price trajectory still encompass great uncertainty significant downturn price seem less likely occur therefore scenario consider copom attribute change domestic gasoline price become less likely occur therefore risk relate materialization increase significantly addition apart effect increase domestic fuel price elevation international oil price affect domestic economy productive chain petrochemical well deterioration market inflation expectation
