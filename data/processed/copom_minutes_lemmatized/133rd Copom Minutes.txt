monetary policy decision
copom evaluate monetary policy contribute consolidation favorable macroeconomic environment economic activity data indicate intensity demand expansion continue quite robust may even accelerate since beginning responsible least partially inflationary pressure observe despite strong import growth benign investment behavior even context moderate deceleration global growth year high volatility observe global market since committee believe accord newly available information balance payment represent imminent risk inflation scenario hand sign relevant inflationary pressure intensify mature emerge economy evidence existence inflationary risk global outlook copom reaffirm vision brazilian inflation alternative scenario intense generalized global deceleration represent ambiguous risk factor one hand reduce net export would act factor restrain aggregate demand moreover potential decrease important commodity price could contribute low domestic inflation hand alternative scenario could unfavorably impact inflation prospect two mechanism case deceleration mature economies comprise global financial market center risk aversion could increase result decreased demand brazilian asset depreciation price addition medium run possible reduction net export could similarly affect price sustainability certain brazilian asset therefore although inflation prospect remain line target trajectory additional uncertainty surround inflation path risk materialization less benign inflationary scenario increase copom emphasize main challenge monetary policy context guarantee maintenance positive result reach last year
