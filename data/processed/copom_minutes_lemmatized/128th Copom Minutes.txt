monetary policy decision
copom reaffirm view express previous minute addition contain inflationary pressure monetary policy also contribute significantly consolidation favorable term macroeconomic environment economic activity data point strengthening possibly intense demand expansion still suggest high probability important pressure inflation addition investment expansion import growth remarkably contribute process complement domestic production therefore limit potential inflationary effect aggregate demand sustain growth moreover despite uncertainty regard continuity strong growth recently observe international economy prospect additional monetary tightening important international market volatility increase global market external outlook remain favorable particularly regard brazilian external financing combination significant trade surplus increase capital inflow suggest balance payment continue perform robustly therefore prospect inflation trajectory remain benign recent meeting copom emphasize main challenge monetary policy context guarantee consolidation positive development anticipate future
copom evaluate increase global inflationary pressure still represent risk domestic inflation trajectory heated demand could increase wholesale price pressure consumer price inflation copom also observe increase ipca inflation expectation twelve month ahead despite level target establish process must monitor sense copom continue manage monetary policy stance gain obtain inflation control recent year become permanent respect copom carefully monitor evolution inflation several core inflation measure discriminate persistent generalized price increase analyze impact inflation expectation promptly adjust monetary policy stance circumstance
preservation inflation rate line target path consolidation stable macroeconomic scenario contribute progressive reduction macroeconomic risk perception underway scope reduction real interest rate future naturally follow consequence improved perception copom evaluate cautious monetary policy stance critical increase probability inflation convergence target path materialize however important look inflation indicator remain consistent recent benign inflation outlook observe last quarter
copom emphasize important time lag transmission monetary policy stance economic activity inflation since beginning monetary easing cycle september selic rate already reduce bulk reduction concentrate last nine month consequently activity level completely mirror effect interest rate cut yet well effect economic activity inflation completely materialize therefore evaluation alternative monetary policy stance necessarily focus prospective inflation scenario risk instead current inflation indicator
coming month employment income expansion credit growth continue bolster economic activity mention recent copom minute activity level also reflect effect governmental transfer fiscal impulse occur first half expect next quarter year consequently lagged effect interest rate cut increasingly robust aggregate demand add factor continue contribute expansion issue become even relevant consider sign heated aggregate demand fact monetary policy decision limit effect predominant impact
light exist incentive expand aggregate demand uncertainty surround monetary policy transmission mechanism low distance current selic rate equilibrium interest rate interest rate cut implement since september copom member understand preservation important achievement disinflation preserve economic growth job creation rise real income demand moment cautious monetary ease stance
copom evaluate since last meeting influence domestic external factor balance risk expected inflation trajectory continue perform opposite direction external sector act importantly increase aggregate supply continue influence inflation prospect predominantly benign way hand expansion domestic demand may increase risk inflation dynamic
participant committee understood consider extension ease process already implement remain uncertainty regard lagged impact monetary easing expected behavior sustain factor expenditure income growth scenario solid expansion domestic demand tradable good service economic activity strengthening deceleration reduction pace selic target rate would contribute extend easing process time
however majority committee argue contribution external sector consolidation benign outlook inflation especially control price tradable good increase investment heated demand environment reduce risk present prospective scenario inflation contribution favor equilibrium aggregate demand domestic supply growth rate pace line monetary policy decision without compromise convergence inflation target trajectory therefore four member committee understood risk balance evolution future inflation would justify reduction selic target rate
give reason state evaluate prospect inflation copom decide reduce selic target rate without bias four vote copom monetary policy action three vote favor reduce selic target basis point copom assess evolution macroeconomic scenario next meeting define next step monetary policy stance
