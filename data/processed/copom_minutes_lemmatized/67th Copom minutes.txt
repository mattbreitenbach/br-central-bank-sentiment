assessment inflation trend
identified shock impact reassess light newly available information scenario consider simulation assume following hypothesis

monetary policy guideline
scenario recovery activity level brazilian economy seem consolidate although slowly level consumer confidence increase since last october stimulate sale retailer turnover increase four consecutive month stabilize december increase reduce inventory last quarter compare previous quarter indicate prospect recovery industrial production industrial production measure ibge grow november decline october seasonally adjust data
existence production capacity trajectory wage income indicate demand growth exert inflationary pressure increase investment capital good observe first quarter effect increase installed capacity impact energy crisis small expect likely end energy rationing enhance potential growth output
recovery economic activity brazil compatible improvement external account upturn trade balance maintenance capital inflow form foreign direct investment contribute reduce brazil risk premium stabilize real surplus u billion trade balance reflect increase export decrease import net flow foreign direct investment u billion finance current account deficit year largely surpass previous projection
year clear sign recovery u economy positive impact global economy may start second quarter would stimulate export ease financing brazilian balance payment argentine crisis additional limited impact exchange rate spread pay brazilian bond
result improvement economic scenario well phase primary effect shock occur low pressure price administer contract prospect inflation rate indicate decline towards target trajectory perception share economic agent indicate expectation inflation survey investor relation group gci central bank brazil
nonetheless point uncertainty remain order confirm favorable outlook inflation attention external scenario essential especially regard aftermath argentine crisis behavior flow foreign capital context domestic electoral process addition attention necessary likely additional pressure arise readjustment price administer contract year finally downward trajectory inflation show slow expect
fact reversal inflation trajectory occur slowly inflation measure ipca remain high despite decline december core inflation measure method remain high december january first sign point low index yet relatively high one contribute result adverse climatic condition distinctly affect several region rain drought upward impact food price ii pressure recompose profit margin effect shock reflex inertia high inflation iii movement slow drop price product
contribution effect shock price administer contract share exceed inflation target deduct impact exchange rate inertia price administer contract estimate approximately inflation inflationary inertia arise high rate inflation exceed inflation target contribute monetary policy orient towards eliminate second round effect shock inflation preserve initial relative price realignment monetary policy addition allow adequate period inflation return target trajectory depend magnitude inherited inertia
light slow fall inflation uncertainty still prevail regard confirmation favorable outlook inflation copom unanimously decide maintain target interest rate
