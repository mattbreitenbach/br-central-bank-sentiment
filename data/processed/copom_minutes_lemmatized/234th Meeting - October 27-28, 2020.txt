discussion conduct monetary policy
regard international economy recent pandemic resurgence consequent increase social distancing major economy may interrupt recovery demand potential abrupt reduction governmental stimulus also bring risk economic recovery however reduction financial asset volatility keep result relatively favorable environment emerge economy still committee judge significant uncertainty evolution scenario
copom member discuss evolution domestic economic activity light available information indicator assess recent data suggest uneven recovery economic activity transfer program government allow relatively strong rebound durable good consumption investment however several service sector activity especially directly affect social distancing measure remain significantly depress prospectively unpredictability associate pandemic evolution necessary adjustment government spending onwards increase uncertainty maintenance economic activity recovery committee consider unpredictability risk associate evolution pandemic may imply domestic scenario characterize even gradual economic recovery
copom member debate level economic slack activity committee believe pandemic continue heterogeneous effect economic sector give nature shock economic slack service sector remain large sector committee conclude nature crisis probably imply disinflationary pressure reduce demand may last long previous recession
committee resume discussion potential effective low limit brazilian policy interest rate connection prudential financial stability issue consider long history brazilian economy operate high level selic rate unprecedented low interest rate may compromise performance market economic sector potential impact financial intermediation majority copom member would already close level interest rate reduction could accompany asset price instability
subsequently copom member discuss maintenance signaling remain space monetary policy stimulus exist small committee assess signaling due prudential restriction regard reduction selic rate therefore keep communication
next committee discuss implementation monetary policy since meeting copom adopt forward guidance accord intend reduce monetary stimulus long specify condition meet committee judge condition continue hold inflation expectation well inflation projection baseline scenario significantly inflation target relevant horizon monetary policy current fiscal regime change inflation expectation remain well anchor
copom continue analysis consider baseline scenario also balance risk restriction prudential nature regardless prudential restriction copom consider moment upward asymmetry balance risk cause fiscal risk sufficient compensate fact inflation projection baseline scenario target relevant horizon committee therefore deem adequate current level monetary stimulus provide maintenance policy rate forward guidance regardless prudential nature restriction
finally committee discuss interpretation fiscal clause forward guidance condition interest rate maintenance current fiscal regime committee judge change fiscal policy affect public debt trajectory compromise fiscal anchor would motivate reassessment even spending ceiling nominal term still maintain reassessment would follow usual guidance inflation target regime base prospective inflation balance risk
monetary policy decision
take account baseline scenario balance risk broad array available information copom unanimously decide maintain selic rate committee judge decision reflect baseline scenario prospective inflation variance balance risk consistent convergence inflation target relevant horizon monetary policy include
committee believe persevere process reform necessary adjustment brazilian economy essential sustainable economic recovery copom also stress uncertainty regard continuation reform agenda permanent change fiscal consolidation process could result increase structural interest rate
copom believe current economic condition continue recommend unusually strong monetary stimulus recognize due prudential financial stability reason remain space monetary policy stimulus exist small
committee deem adequate current level monetary stimulus provide maintenance policy rate forward guidance introduce meeting forward guidance state copom intend reduce monetary stimulus long specify condition meet committee judge condition continue hold inflation expectation well inflation projection baseline scenario significantly inflation target relevant horizon monetary policy current fiscal regime change inflation expectation remain well anchor
