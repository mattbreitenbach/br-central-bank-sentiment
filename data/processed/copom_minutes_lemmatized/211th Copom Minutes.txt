assumption copom inflation projection stand around percent percent percent
risk around baseline inflation scenario
committee emphasize baseline scenario involve risk direction
one hand possible effect favorable food price shock low current level industrial good inflation ii possible propagation inertial mechanism low inflation level may lead prospective inflation trajectory
hand iii frustration expectation regard continuation reform necessary adjustment brazilian economy may affect risk premia increase path inflation relevant horizon conduct monetary policy risk intensify case iv reversal current benign global outlook emerge economy
discussion conduct monetary policy
committee discuss evolution economic activity light available data member agree economy remain gradual recovery path improvement employment even early stage process conjuncture lead increase growth projection current year consistent view recovery consolidated committee emphasize vision owe current level slack economy marginal revision intensity recovery would lead material revision expected path inflation
regard global outlook committee confirm recent favorable evolution global economy show gradual economic recovery without exert excessive pressure financial condition advanced economy committee acknowledge continue process normalization monetary policy major country lead slightly less accommodative global financial condition despite limited impact emerge economy far context copom reaffirm brazilian economy show great capacity absorb occasional setback global economy give robust balance payment low inflation environment anchor expectation prospect economic recovery nevertheless copom point risk brazilian economy reversal benign global outlook context frustration expectation regard necessary reform adjustment economy
copom analyze inflation trajectory throughout subsequent year member agree prospect inflation large extent evolve expect
committee assess current situation domestic electric power generation sector incorporate recent change tariff baseline scenario inflation next year aggregate administer price constitute inflationary shock opposite direction substantially great magnitude dynamic food price constitute relevant disinflationary shock prospect percent price reduction year food home component measure ipca explain large share inflation deviation percent target set current year
regard monetary policy consensus case possible relative price adjustment result supply shock anchored inflation expectation monetary policy address effect shock committee reiterate reaction possible change relative price food possible adjustment electric power tariff symmetric say monetary policy follow principle face inflationary disinflationary supply shock
copom discuss level path inflation include component sensitive business cycle monetary policy measure underlie inflation consider comfortable level others low level committee also discuss extent trajectory compatible convergence inflation towards target within relevant horizon monetary policy
copom reaffirm view monetary policy flexibility react risk direction risk effect supply shock propagation low current level inflation lead expected prospective inflation trajectory well risk setback global outlook context frustration expectation reform necessary adjustment
committee express view economic condition anchored inflation expectation measure underlie inflation run comfortable level inflation projection little target high level economic slack prescribe accommodative monetary policy interest rate structural level although estimate rate involve high degree uncertainty committee member express understanding current real interest rate provide stimulus economy
copom understand process reform necessary adjustment brazilian economy contribute reduction structural interest rate committee continue reassess estimate rate time
committee understand give estimate length monetary easing cycle pace ease depends stage cycle without necessarily reflect change baseline scenario risk balance
copom member agree evolution outlook balance risk since october meeting meeting take place expect therefore compatible selic rate reduction percent per year
committee discuss next step conduct monetary policy one hand evaluate several measure underlie inflation comfortable low level include component sensitive economic cycle monetary policy reflect path inflation towards target hand ponder risk current inflationary environment may interrupt frustration expectation continuity necessary reform adjustment brazilian economy particularly context reversal current favorable external scenario emerge economy
committee deem appropriate signal long outlook evolve accord copom baseline scenario stage ease cycle additional moderate reduction magnitude ease next meeting seem adequate current perspective however deem appropriate warn view susceptible change evolution scenario associate risk previous meeting
copom also assess extension cycle convenience signal step subsequent next meeting consensus maintain freedom action signal current stage cycle recommend caution conduct monetary policy
committee reaffirm preference communicate conditionality evolution monetary policy well transmit economic rationality guide decision contribute increase transparency improve copom communication context highlight ease process continue depend evolution economic activity balance risk possible reassessment extension cycle length inflation projection expectation
