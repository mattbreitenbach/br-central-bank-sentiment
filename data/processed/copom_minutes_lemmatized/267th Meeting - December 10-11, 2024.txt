scenario risk analysis
inflation outlook turn challenging several dimension committee initially analyzed economic activity aggregate demand inflation expectation current inflation international scenario copom discuss inflation projection expectation deliberate current decision future communication
look current economic activity period scenario resilient activity persist dynamism show third quarter gdp release lead new reassessment positive gap labor market also continue heat increase employed population drop unemployment rate increase job formalization nevertheless moderation pace wage growth different survey despite remain high level combination robust labor market expansionary fiscal policy vigorous broad credit grant continue support consumption consequently aggregate demand particular pace growth household consumption gross fix capital formation indicate domestic demand grow fairly strong pace despite tighten monetary policy committee discuss reason dichotomy note mitigate element concurrent impact monetary policy activity credit fiscal stimulus maintain unobstructed monetary policy channel element mitigate action contribute effective efficient conduct
however regard prospective activity element suggest slowdown tightened financial condition case committee point economy surprisingly resilient committee monitor process understand reduction output gap forecast projection inherent orderly functioning transmission mechanism achievement inflation target addition uncertainty deceleration process question whether expected slowdown due restriction production factor drop demand still debate highly different impact inflationary process
along activity credit mainly capital market also surprise throughout year volume growth expect despite high interest rate note despite resilience activity environment high interest rate high level delinquency income commitment require additional caution diligence grant credit
financial condition exchange rate undergo sharp change recently combination depreciated exchange rate rise nominal real interest rate curve make environment complex recall exchange rate price increase demand strong expectation deanchored exchange rate path consider persistent committee therefore monitor closely exchange rate financial condition transmit price activity
regard economic policy broadly committee remain firmly convince policy must predictable credible particular slowdown essential part process smooth rebalancing economy committee debate highlight need harmonious fiscal monetary policy
perception agent recent fiscal announcement significantly impact asset price expectation especially risk premium inflation expectation exchange rate fact inflation expectation measure different instrument obtain different group agent rise time horizon indicate deanchoring notable inflation premium embed financial instrument inflation expectation rise period make inflation scenario adverse require contractionary monetary policy deanchoring inflation expectation factor discomfort share committee member must tame
inflation scenario deteriorate food price rise significantly due among factor drought observe throughout year rise beef price also affect cattle cycle increase tend spread give presence important inertial mechanism brazilian economy regard industrialized good recent exchange rate movement pressure price margin suggest great increase component coming month finally service inflation great inertia remain level require meet inflation target context dynamic activity increase recent reading fact interruption disinflationary process also great inflationary pressure late reading copom emphasize inflationary driver intensify since previous meeting positive output gap even dynamic labor market additional exchange rate depreciation high current inflation deanchored inflation expectation make convergence inflation target challenging
external environment remain challenge significant economic geopolitical uncertainty regard uncertainty persists pace disinflation economic activity slowdown time possibility change conduct economic policy also bring additional uncertainty scenario particularly possible fiscal stimulus restriction labor supply introduction import tariff committee reference scenario continue gradual orderly slowdown economy committee reinforce central bank commitment achieve target fundamental ingredient disinflationary process corroborate recent indication cautious monetary ease cycle several country usual committee focus transmission mechanism external environment domestic inflation dynamic impact outlook copom also emphasize context great global uncertainty abrupt exchange rate movement require great caution conduct domestic monetary policy
committee discuss estimate neutral interest rate would use assumption projection neutral rate unobservable variable subject great uncertainty estimation due intrinsic uncertainty nature variable committee reinforce neutral rate variable update frequently abrupt movement except exceptional case context committee raise neutral real interest rate model continue evaluate assumption
copom assess determinant exchange rate current inflation well determinant output gap inflation expectation deteriorate copom look projection reference scenario interest rate path extract focus survey exchange rate start evolves accord purchase power parity ppp committee assume oil price follow approximately future market curve following six month start increase per year moreover energy tariff flag assume green december year
reference scenario inflation projection second quarter table inflation projection calendar year respectively
copom reinforce view slowdown structural reform effort fiscal discipline increase earmarked credit uncertainty public debt stabilization potential raise economy neutral interest rate deleterious impact power monetary policy consequently cost disinflation term activity
due materialization risk committee judge scenario less uncertain adverse previous meeting upside inflation risk resilience service inflation deanchoring expectation exchange rate depreciation materialize result scenario quite uncertain become adverse
however risk inflation scenario remain tilted upside among upside risk inflation outlook inflation expectation emphasize prolonged period deanchoring inflation expectation ii resilience service inflation due positive output gap iii conjunction internal external economic policy inflationary impact example persistently depreciated currency among downside risk note deceleration global economic activity ii impact global inflation large expect monetary policy tightening
discussion conduct monetary policy
copom discuss conduct monetary policy consider set projection evaluate well balance risk prospective inflation
committee assess deterioration inflation scenario occur reflect inflation expectation projection conclude determinant exchange rate current inflation determinant output gap inflation expectation deteriorate significantly worsen call even contractionary monetary policy
committee unanimously decide increase selic rate announce expect scenario confirm anticipate adjustment magnitude next two meeting discussion lead decision two dimension discuss length firstly magnitude deterioration inflation scenario require timely policy action maintain firm commitment converge inflation target secondly several risk materialize make scenario adverse less uncertain allow committee great visibility provide indication anticipate next decision
total magnitude tightening cycle determine firm commitment reach inflation target depend inflation dynamic especially component sensitive economic activity monetary policy inflation projection inflation expectation output gap balance risk
monetary policy decision
current scenario mark additional deanchoring inflation expectation increase inflation projection economic activity widening output gap require even contractionary monetary policy
copom therefore decide increase selic rate judge decision consistent strategy inflation convergence level around target throughout relevant horizon monetary policy without compromise fundamental objective ensure price stability decision also imply smooth economic fluctuation foster full employment
light adverse scenario inflation convergence committee anticipate adjustment magnitude next two meeting scenario evolve expect total magnitude tightening cycle determine firm commitment reach inflation target depend inflation dynamic especially component sensitive economic activity monetary policy inflation projection inflation expectation output gap balance risk
