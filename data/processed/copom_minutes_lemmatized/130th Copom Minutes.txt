monetary policy decision
copom reaffirm view express previous minute addition contain inflationary pressure monetary policy also contribute significantly consolidation favorable term macroeconomic environment economic activity data indicate pace demand expansion remain robust may increase probability significant inflationary pressure inflation investment expansion import growth contribute retard process limit potential inflationary effect stem aggregate demand sustain growth moreover despite uncertainty regard continuity strong growth international economy heighten volatility global market last month prospect brazilian external financing forecast period suggest accord information available balance payment present risk inflation scenario hand recent evidence point intensification risk global inflation outlook suggest evolution raw material price therefore although inflation prospect remain line target path additional uncertainty surround outlook recent meeting copom emphasize main challenge monetary policy context guarantee consolidation positive development anticipate future
