monetary policy decision
copom evaluate monetary policy contribute consolidation favorable term macroeconomic environment international market risk aversion increase since last copom meeting largely due concern sovereign debt european country although liquidity international market reduce prospect external funding brazilian economy remain favorable line great risk aversion scarce liquidity price select commodity brazilian asset decrease another front trajectory price index evidence inflationary pressure relevant economy context influence international scenario domestic inflation path ambiguous although uncertainty persists behavior asset price commodity context worsen international financial condition copom assess scenario deteriorate depend dynamic derive market distrust regard solvency european economy hand recognize baseline scenario consider regardless aspect international outlook evolve copom reaffirm main challenge monetary policy ensure favorable result obtain last year preserve
copom believe indicator release since last meeting reinforce perception existence pressure market factor increase probability initially localize inflationary episode pose risk inflation trajectory context risk upward cost pressure wholesale price inflation consumer price inflation increase well committee state materialization well spread initially localize pressure consumer price continue depend critically economic agent expectation inflation idleness degree economy among factor therefore variable part information set take account generation inflation forecast bcb constitute key element committee assessment prospective inflation scenario additionally note behavior domestic demand exert pressure price item service consider prospect evolution main factor sustain aggregate demand may continue event committee reaffirm commitment continue conduct action order ensure gain obtain inflation control recent year become permanent

short despite withdrawal substantial share stimulus introduce recent international financial crisis since last meeting risk achievement benign inflationary scenario inflation would remain consistent inflation target remain elevated hand worth note period external development introduce certain amount caution analysis prospective scenario anyway prevailing opinion among committee member monetary policy adjust incisively order avoid great uncertainty detect short horizon spread long horizon
consideration continue adjustment process monetary condition prospective scenario economy order ensure convergence inflation target path copom unanimously decide increase selic rate without bias
regime copom guide decision accord project inflation analysis several alternative scenario evolution main variable determine look dynamic price balance risk associate projection domestic demand appear robust largely due effect stimulus factor income growth credit resumption moreover fiscal credit incentive provide economy recent quarter contribute consolidation activity expansion hence reduction residual idleness margin productive factor effect stimulus however counter effect reversal substantial share initiative take recent international financial crisis possible deepening fiscal crisis several european country face element important part context future monetary policy decision take aim ensure timely convergence inflation target path
addition bear notice consensus among committee member need adapt pace adjustment basic interest rate development prospective inflation scenario well corresponding balance risk order limit impact cause behavior current inflation underlie price dynamic
