monetary policy guideline
recent data indicator regard activity level confirm continuity last month cool economic trend observe since end first quarter reflect impact international scenario energy crisis expectation domestic economy
contribution various factor economic deceleration difficult assess nonetheless reduction aggregate demand seem main factor respond worsening economic performance compare restriction impose aggregate supply stem energy crisis reduction demand may explain worsening external scenario reflex energy shortage expectation recent tightening monetary policy perception deceleration world economy shall long forecast beginning year conjunction evolution argentina crisis contribute downward revision expectation concern brazilian economic growth negative impact aggregate demand expectation also influence energy crisis affect entrepreneur consumer confidence monetary policy action addition direct impact interest rate hike demand also reflect market expectation reveal steepening slope interest rate curve since last march shift expectation accelerate impact monetary policy cooling demand may pose downward pressure inflation rate
notwithstanding fall inflation expect near future due scenario economic deceleration response exchange rate continue source concern still risk exchange rate passthrough domestic price stem accumulate depreciation since beginning year risk become intense depreciation start perceive permanent demand recovers
short run uncertainty concern exchange rate market dissipate medium run give transitory nature shock economic policy reaction reasonable assume improvement balance payment materialize moreover order reduce impact unfavorable international conjuncture eventual adverse impact economy brazilian government count new imf program contemplate u billion financial resource
