risk around reference inflation scenario
copom reference scenario inflation encompasses risk factor direction
one hand possible reversion even partial increase price international commodity measure local currency would produce projected inflation reference scenario
hand fiscal policy imply additional impulse aggregate demand deteriorate future fiscal path may negative impact price important financial asset well pressure country risk premia
spite favorable public account data committee assess uncertainty regard fiscal framework maintain elevate risk deanchoring inflation expectation therefore upward asymmetry balance risk imply high probability inflation path one project reference scenario
discussion conduct monetary policy
uncertainty regard future current fiscal framework result increase risk premia raise risk deanchoring inflation expectation imply assign great probability alternative scenario consider high neutral interest rate committee reiterate process reform necessary adjustment brazilian economy essential sustainable economic growth weakness structural reform effort permanent change fiscal consolidation process could result increase structural interest rate additionally committee note even fiscal policy downward effect inflation short term cause deterioration country risk premia increase inflation expectation consequently upward effect prospective inflation
next copom discuss implementation monetary policy consider reference scenario also balance risk inflation accord reference scenario use interest rate path extract focus survey exchange rate evolve accord purchase power parity inflation projection upper limit tolerance band target around target
balance risk committee ponder risk deanchoring expectation derive development fiscal scenario sustain upward bias projection reference scenario hence consider bias due asymmetric risk copom evaluate projection target therefore copom conclude monetary tightening process restrictive use reference scenario throughout relevant horizon
next copom assess appropriate pace interest rate hike analyze inflation projection use simulation monetary policy path different terminal rate adjustment pace duration monetary tightening worth note scenario consider consistent convergence inflation target assume high interest rate path use reference scenario
base result copom member discuss appropriate strategy committee conclude another adjustment percentage point follow additional adjustment slow pace next meeting appropriate strategy achieve sufficient monetary tightening ensure inflation convergence relevant horizon well anchoring inflation expectation
finally particularly high uncertainty surround important asset commodity price well stage tightening cycle lead committee judge appropriate moment signal size future step
monetary policy decision
take account reference scenario balance risk broad array available information copom unanimously decide increase selic rate committee judge decision reflect reference scenario prospective inflation variance balance risk consistent convergence inflation target throughout relevant horizon monetary policy include large degree without compromise fundamental objective ensure price stability decision also imply smoothing economic fluctuation foster full employment
committee considers give increase inflation projection risk deanchoring expectation appropriate advance process monetary tighten significantly restrictive territory committee emphasize persist strategy disinflation process expectation anchor around target consolidate
next step committee foresees adequate moment reduction pace adjustment interest rate indication reflect stage tighten cycle cumulative effect manifest relevant horizon copom emphasize future policy step could adjust ensure convergence inflation towards target depend evolution economic activity balance risk inflation expectation projection relevant horizon monetary policy
