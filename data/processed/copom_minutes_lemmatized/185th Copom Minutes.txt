monetary policy decision
copom emphasize international evidence ratify brazilian experience indicate high inflation rate generate distortion lead high risk depress investment distortion manifest example shortening planning horizon household company government well deterioration businessmen confidence committee also emphasize high inflation rate reduce purchase power wage transfer negative repercussion household confidence consumption therefore high inflation rate reduce growth potential economy well job income generation
view copom evaluate monetary policy contribute consolidation favorable macroeconomic environment respect copom reassure inflation target regime guide decision accord bcb project inflation base analysis alternative scenario evolution main variable determine price dynamic copom also understand low risk underlying inflation short run tend reduce uncertainty regard future behavior headline inflation facilitate assessment scenario monetary authority well help process coordination economic agent expectation particularly price setter additionally noteworthy low risk underlying inflation short run tend intensify effect monetary policy action enable affect manner dynamic headline inflation future although copom recognize macroeconomic policy action may influence price trajectory reaffirm view particularly responsibility monetary policy remain especially vigilant guarantee pressure detect shorter horizon spread long horizon
copom considers since last meeting risk global financial stability remain high particularly derive change yield curve slope major advanced economy despite identify low probability occurrence extreme event international financial market committee considers external environment remain complex committee despite recently release data less positive anticipate prospect intense global activity throughout relevant horizon monetary policy remain improvement advanced economy recovery activity country acceleration pace growth others although general space use monetary policy economy remain limited fiscal restraint scenario prevail upcoming year important emerge economy however activity pace match expectation despite resilience domestic demand committee highlight evidence tension volatility focus currency market well prospect moderation dynamic commodity price international market despite recently observe localized pressure
copom considers expansion rate domestic absorption gdp rate converge domestic activity expansion pace tend less intense year compare medium term committee evaluate important change must take place composition aggregate supply demand context consumption tend grow moderate pace observe recent year investment tend gain momentum regard external component aggregate demand scenario great global growth combine depreciation brl contribute make component favorable brazilian economy growth focus supply side committee evaluate long term favorable prospect competitiveness industry agriculture emerge service sector tend grow rate low record recent year committee plausible claim development couple advance term qualification labor force program public service concession reflect efficient allocation production factor economy productivity gain committee also highlight speed materialization aforementioned change resulting gain depend strengthening company household confidence
copom observe main inflation scenario consider materialization assumed trajectory regard fiscal variable arising condition relevant horizon monetary policy balance public sector shift neutral zone committee also note generation primary surplus line work hypothesis consider inflation projection would contribute create positive perception regard macroeconomic environment medium long term also bear emphasize generation primary surplus level close average generate recent year would contribute reduce public debt financing cost favorable impact cost capital general would stimulate private investment medium long term
