monetary policy decision
copom evaluate monetary policy contribute consolidation favorable term macroeconomic environment economic activity data indicate pace domestic demand expansion continue quite robust third quarter least partially responsible inflationary pressure considerably lose momentum since deceleration partly result substantial generalized cooling economy activity emerge economy turn increase risk aversion unprecedentedly constraint observe liquidity condition international market continue impose adjustment balance payment general term influence external scenario future trajectory brazilian inflation continue subject contradictory effect act distinct intensity throughout time surround significant uncertainty one hand economic cooling cause increase risk aversion impact demand brazilian asset consequently depreciate price hand generalized economic deceleration last month may persist upcoming quarter cause cooling commodity price external demand also negatively impacted local financial condition moreover trajectory price index evidence reduction inflationary external pressure especially mature economy also emerge economy consequence net effect global deceleration inflation trajectory seem far predominantly benign copom emphasize main challenge monetary policy context guarantee maintenance favorable result achieve last year
copom evaluate probability initially localize inflationary pressure may cause risk domestic inflation trajectory diminish evidence accommodation domestic demand reduction inflationary pressure market factor despite remain surround uncertainty may mitigate risk wholesale price show deflation last month upward pressure consumer price inflation committee evaluate materialization well generalization pressure initially localize consumer price depend critically economic agent inflation expectation inflation expectation remain level inflation target despite remarkably decrease since last copom meeting continue carefully monitor additionally worth notice accord data available domestic demand exert less pressure price tradable item service upcoming quarter context copom reaffirm continue conduct action order ensure gain obtain inflation control recent year become permanent
copom emphasizes important time lag implementation monetary policy effect economic activity inflation therefore evaluation alternative option monetary policy necessarily focus inflation scenario risk instead current inflation index point view even important period high uncertainty
prospect evolution economic activity continue deteriorate since last copom meeting despite fact industrial activity data partially reflect process inventory retreat tend exhaust particularly important notice effect international crisis domestic financial condition result severe decline credit contribution support domestic demand additionally intensification international crisis cause negative effect consumer businessmen confidence situation persist strength economic activity increasingly depend payroll expansion effect governmental transfer expect consideration become even relevant consider fact monetary policy decision concentrate impact upcoming quarter
copom evaluate loss strength domestic demand result reduction inflationary pressure hand remain risk inflationary dynamic derive trajectory brazilian asset price amidst process decrease external source funding mechanism price adjustment contribute prolong inflationary pressure observe last year balance influence prospective trajectory inflation crucial assessment various alternative available monetary policy stance
international evidence well brazilian experience indicate high inflation rate lead increase risk premium shorten plan horizon consequently lower potential economic growth besides regressive effect income distribution therefore copom strategy aim bring inflation back midpoint target already establish cmn keep consistent level relative target path strategy result evidence throughout time take account time lag transmission mechanism adequate deal uncertainty inherent process monetary policy formulation implementation
copom evaluate light sign economic activity slowdown evidence since last meeting regarding instance industrial production indicator exacerbate inventory cycle available data labor market industrial capacity utilization rate well consumer businessmen confidence together low inflation expectation relevant horizon risk benign inflation scenario ipca would resume evolution line target path markedly reduce indeed evolution prospective scenario reflect inflation projection consider committee copom also understand demand deceleration reduce pressure supply condition observe significantly contribute deflate economy still monetary policy cautiously conduct aim assure convergence inflation target path despite scope easing process
committee believe consolidation restrictive financial condition long period exert significant contraction effect demand throughout time relevant deflation pressure circumstance majority copom member take account balance risk economic activity consequently prospective inflation scenario well absence clear evidence effect inflation stem depreciation exchange rate environment global reduction inflationary pressure decide moment reduce selic rate bps
