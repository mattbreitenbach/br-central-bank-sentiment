core ipca inflation calculate exclude household food item regulate price may compare april accumulated change month
core ipca inflation calculate method register may compare april last month core inflation accumulate increase worth mention methodology use measure particular smooth change certain item result influence high inflation result exchange rate depreciation second half
core inflation calculate symmetric method register increase may month core inflation accumulate increase core measure inflation index also influence exchange rate shock last year
june wholesale price continue reflect exchange rate appreciation register additional decline already signal partial result june inflation consumer price index come upward pressure price rice milk dairy product clothing price however pressure low observe may also expect decline price fresh food beef fuel facilitate deceleration monthly inflation
assessment inflation trend
identified shock impact reassess accord newly available information scenario consider simulation assume following hypothesis price gasoline estimate increase compare last copom meeting price adjustment bottled cooking gas result fall compare last month cook gas forecast increase forecast include price readjustment occur current date result exchange rate appreciation new estimate general price index readjustment electricity telephone tariff estimate respectively include readjustment occur current date regulate price weight may ipca forecast increase exchange rate appreciation decrease estimate electricity telephone price readjustment result fall may projection regulate price forecast increase projection spread selic rate follow specification var model use selic swap rate eve copom meeting gradually rise end
regard fiscal policy assume public sector accomplish primary surplus target year following two year gdp related assumption establish
may copom meeting maintain
consider baseline scenario hypothesis include maintenance selic interest rate exchange rate level prevail eve copom meeting inflation project adjusted target target
monetary policy decision
monthly inflation fall year three basic factor explain recent behavior first high inflation rate observe beginning year result delayed effect price strong exchange rate depreciation observe last year increase inflation persistence agent adjust price wage base past inflation second recent exchange rate appreciation reduce pressure company cost wholesale price although still resistance among retail price tradable good recent exchange rate appreciation consumer price tend stabilize without additional readjustment pressure third monetary policy successful reduce inflation expectation inflation pressure control aggregate demand
inflation persistence contribute continuation high inflation initial month year high inflation persistence cause increase practice price readjustment corresponding decline price readjustment base future inflation behavior aim improve profit margin initial month year lead significant decrease sale environment low demand monetary policy commit prevent price readjustment perpetuate high inflation
consequence high inflation persistence velocity fall monthly inflation low expect since inflation peak november ipca inflation drop april fall may similar behavior observe analyze trend market price inflation item decrease gradually may november
hand exchange rate appreciation contribute reduction cost pressure inflation maintenance appropriate fiscal monetary policy well recent increase international liquidity contribute continuation exchange rate appreciation rollover rate private security direct loan continue increase country risk measure continue decline fall eve june copom meeting eve may copom meeting demonstrate recovery international confidence conduct economic policy brazil
economic activity continue decelerate intensity duration deceleration similar observe recent period brazilian history however due change relative price especially regard price tradable good compare price deceleration activity uniform sector relate export include agribusiness mineral extraction industry expand hand durable good sector internal consumer depend domestic credit condition depressed compare month last year
accord factor explain monthly inflation remain downward trend decrease ipca inflation may strongly influence reduction good price result mainly normalization supply perishable food nevertheless group also show reduction inflation pressure decrease price gasoline base auto fuel main factor contribute reduction regulated price inflation exclude increase electricity urban bus water sewage tariff ipca would increase instead observe may decline consumer price inflation follow deflation wholesale price agricultural industrial
also may few price ipca adjust upward compare april value much low maximum value series since observe january price item ipca increase
core inflation also decline free price equivalent core inflation calculate exclude regulated price increase may compare april point annualized inflation behavior core inflation calculate exclude regulate price household food item similar decrease may april
core inflation increase compare april methodology readjustment item concentrate short period year smooth avoid exclusion core inflationary shock occur core tend affect past pressure show resistance fall exclude effect produce smoothing process downward trend core inflation clear fall april may another way measure core inflation avoid influence exchange rate shock substitute current period smooth value correspond value observe past month base criterion core would april may respectively
