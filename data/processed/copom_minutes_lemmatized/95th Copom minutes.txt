assessment inflation trend
identified shock impact reassess accord new available information scenario consider simulation assume following hypothesis projection evolution gasoline price maintain projection bottled cooking gas revise year
march projection projection household electricity tariff increase since last copom meeting regard telephone tariff copom maintain projection practically unchanged previous meeting regard regulate price total weight march ipca rise project projection make previous meeting projection readjustment regulated price maintain figure result model endogenous determination take account seasonal component exchange rate behavior market price inflation igp change projection spread selic rate follow specification vector autoregressive model use selic swap rate eve copom meeting start second quarter reach fourth quarter
regard fiscal policy assume primary surplus target gdp following two year achieve related assumption consider previous meeting maintain
consider hypothesis low persistence inflation consider copom since march benchmark scenario hypothesis include maintenance rate exchange rate close level prevail eve copom meeting ipca inflation project slightly target target accord market scenario take account consensus exchange rate selic rate survey investor relation group gerin eve copom meeting inflation project central target
monetary policy decision
inflation register ipca decrease second consecutive month level close ceiling market expectation month pressure high among market price change tradable item respectively regulated price fell contribute significantly march inflation reduction far item contribute intensely inflation variation first quarter tradable regulated item change respectively consequence increase tradable inflation rate contribution group ipca increase first quarter year compare last quarter explain almost inflation acceleration inflation measure national consumer index close one observe ipca however general price index show relatively high rate increase march increase january february respectively
contrast deceleration headline index various core ipca measure calculate method increase march reverse february fall core inflation calculate smoothing item increase core inflation calculate without smoothing procedure rise core inflation calculate exclude household food item regulate price decrease march february ratio item ipca positive variation month increase keep within usual range note increase measure core inflation inflation dispersion could justify consequence recent increase wholesale price even remain moderate expect compatible favorable inflation scenario
economic activity continue recovery trend despite fall industrial production february compare january fall anticipate march minute fully consistent usual economic recovery cycle relate sharp rebound second half recovery fast intense become clear new industrial output series release april ibge accord new series second half industrial production high first half old series record growth period high industrial production level brazilian history reach november seasonally adjusted growth compare trough observe june however accord new series industrial production decline since november spite signal show continuous economic recovery new series also show high growth semi good sector old series indicate december month low output accord new series peak month seasonally adjusted growth compare trough july
several lead coincident indicator confirm copom evaluation regard positive activity trend package paper production sustain upward trend initiate september automobile production increase march average real earnings six metropolitan area ibge monthly employment survey increase february second consecutive month accord data cni brasil fiesp são paulo real earnings industry currently high level one observe regard fiesp data employment growth first quarter high since indicate industrial production growth already affect job creation retail sale accord ibge data seasonally adjust bcb increase january compare previous month reach level high month accord data seasonally adjust bcb real sale great são paulo continue increase show growth february compare previous month credit operation also sustain upward trend despite fall consumer sentiment march april retail sale apparently affect
brazilian external account continue show impressive positive result trade balance march high month reach u billion first quarter year compare u billion period despite economic growth year bcb project trade balance surplus similar current account remain positive accumulate u billion surplus first quarter risk measure brazil stabilize increase period eve copom meeting march april brazil fell level close exchange rate remain almost stable around
general external environment remain favorable world growth perspectives help brazilian trade balance furthermore anticipation interest rate hike disclosure sale consumer inflation data march change significantly cost availability external funding brazil despite eventual turbulence short run scenario rise fed fund already incorporate asset price addition remarkable adjustment brazilian current account reduction public debt contribute significantly mitigate effect deterioration international liquidity financing balance payment also effect foreign exchange market
although inflation first quarter high expect market expectation remain relatively stable small increase expect inflation mainly due incorporation actual rate end december accord gerin inflation expectation first quarter stood actual inflation reach effect expectation marginal expectation remain satisfactorily anchor inflation expectation remain steady inflation expectation next month rise slightly since last copom meeting
copom consider bcb inflation projection hypothesis low degree persistence first quarter inflation follow seasonal inflation pattern observe last year accord benchmark scenario suppose maintenance selic rate exchange rate forecasting horizon inflation slightly target target accord market scenario incorporate consensus exchange rate selic rate eve copom meeting bcb projection target accumulated inflation rise two scenario inflation march market scenario project high inflation rate benchmarked scenario assume decline trend interest rate well small increase exchange rate
projected inflation april two scenario close one expect top forecasting institution institution accurate forecast short run incorporate expectation projection scenario recently do copom change projected inflation significantly
consider inflation scenario committee decide unanimously reduce target rate without bias committee understood reduction coherent last meeting diagnosis consider likely benign scenario low inflation persistence next month low wholesale price retail price
copom evaluate cautious monetary stance essential increase likelihood inflation converge target accordingly inflation indicator must continue consistent low hypothesis consider
monetary stance different crisis period one observe end beginning time great macroeconomic stability one recently establish therefore crisis revert interest rate still considerably high interest rate cut large however different interest rate dynamic take place time great macroeconomic stability inflation convergence targeted path along sustained economic recovery monitor carefully
committee stress pointless infer moderate cut interest rate corresponds negative evaluation future behavior inflation cause pessimism future path economic activity contrary natural result progressive normalization economic environment precisely fall average interest rate cut addition allow monetary easing procedure enable smooth transition scenario price stability economic growth small market interest rate volatility medium run
closing meeting announce copom would meet may technical presentation following day order discuss monetary policy decision establish communiqué october summary data analyze copom
