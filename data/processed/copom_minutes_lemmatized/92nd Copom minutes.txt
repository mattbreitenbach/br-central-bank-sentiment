monetary policy decision
inflation accelerate november december consumer inflation measure ipca rise december november acceleration verify three ipca tradable regulated price increase inflation december also capture consumer price index well wholesale price index general price index preliminary result january anticipate change pattern short run
core inflation measure also increase december show december figure attribute behavior specific item high increase observe core ipca inflation calculate exclude household food price regulate price rise december remain stable range july november albeit low intensity core ipca core calculate mean method also increase december another evidence price increase spread high ratio good ipca basket positive variation increase december november high rate since may
assess available information inflation increase december might isolate occurrence owe seasonal factor might signal persistent trend certain seasonal extraordinary factor contribute december result hypothesis true inflation return target path medium term similar happen last september
copom maintain recovery scenario outline last meeting accord ibge industrial output increase november reach high level ever july november quarterly moving average industrial output increase capital good post high increase durable consumer good grow result increase credit supply segment semi consumer good show significant growth rate depend strongly real earnings industrial output likely continue expand signal lead indicator electricity consumption steel output flow heavy vehicle highway low level inventory sector automobile gradual recovery real income credit contribute high industrial output capital good absorption increase july november production input civil construction increase period increase investment essential sustainable growth path imbalance supply demand
retail sale growth november surpass industrial production growth first time since beginning upturn accord ibge data seasonally adjust bcb volume sale brazil rise october november quarterly moving average take result november sixth increase row growth sharper sector dependent credit automobile furniture appliance several indicator anticipate continuous recovery consumption include strong consumer sentiment low default rate real payroll growth low unemployment rate fell november october
copom restate strong contribution monetary policy recovery less credit sensitive sector industry retail stem indirect impact high employment real earnings initially concentrate sensitive sector gradually spread whole economy result additional monetary stimulus could produce short term large gap recovery pace different activity generate inflationary pressure leading one
previous month performance external sector extremely favorable good result trade balance current account balance latter closing surplus approximately u billion first positive result since besides private external borrowing surpass u billion beginning year measure morgan chase remain downward trend fall december january copom meeting significant trade surplus open international market brazilian company favorable scenario external account allow real appreciate last copom meeting consequence dollar fell even bcb announce first week january start international reserve accumulation policy
even though consistent seasonal pattern recent inflation acceleration make market participant revise upwards first quarter inflation expectation revision lead accurate market analyst inflation forecast eve last two copom meeting median market inflation expectation first quarter increase however five accurate forecaster consider top forecaster expect inflation rise whole median market inflation expectation remain stable respectively
bcb inflation projection accord benchmark scenario assume unchanged selic rate exchange rate target target market scenario consider exchange rate depreciation rate decrease expect market participant eve copom meeting bcb inflation estimate slightly target target
one member committee consider cut target selic rate would adequate current environment take account pace recovery activity stability market inflation expectation favorable exchange rate behavior bcb inflation projection benchmark market scenario
committee member decide keep rate unchanged continue monetary ease consistent signal risk inflation deviate target low enough several consideration support decision
differently see last september current inflation acceleration episode even factor may trigger inflationary pressure long period impact associate increase fresh food price education price electricity tariff high initially expect inflation pressure high long originally expect maneuver room bring inflation back target reduce first month year
also differently september despite fact inflation pressure december first month partially seasonal hit economy period strong demand therefore room realignments relative price develop pressure inflation
even though sufficient information precise diagnosis factor cause surge inflation december increase inflation expectation february period signal suggest trend may persist firstly already outline core inflation partial inflation figure january anticipate inflation slowdown secondly increase industrial ipa december may put pressure consumer inflation next month especially high demand environment increase wholesale price trigger several factor include increase world commodity price high demand intermediate good change relative price benefit sector directly favor growth demand thus enable increase profit margin
high change industrial ipa differs happen last september high ipca variation accompany increase agricultural ipa industrial ipa remain strong inflation pressure also suggest fgv survey january show company interview intend increase price first quarter year historical data show important statistical correlation intention industrial wholesale price
recent appreciation real dollar undoubtedly important factor consider however copom believe current environment effect exchange rate appreciation inflation intense exchange rate floating main determinant change tradable good price reais u dollar depreciation relation relevant currency euro japanese yen account also world economy growth u dollar depreciation push commodity price may pressure wholesale price brazil occur
stable inflation expectation suggest market consider first quarter inflation increase temporary also believe increase compensate reduction following quarter exogenous factor trigger reduction assume monetary policy responsible produce compensatory effect
accord forecasting exercise carry bcb describe paragraph inflation forecast first quarter substitute top inflation expectation suppose unchanged rate exchange rate project inflation come inflation target upward reevaluation due new estimate first quarter inflation inertial impact remain quarter exchange rate interest rate path expect market take inflation project target target
copom understood recent inflation acceleration increase inflation projection might event occur last september possible accommodation inflation high level even take grant acceleration really temporary increase inflation projection enough suggest caution monetary management already mention possible establish accurately impact reduction rate june december output gap inflation consider strong possibility inflation deviate target monetary policy act preemptively prudent monetary management risk upturn trend course since third quarter
thus copom weight risk follow monetary easing case inflation deviate target need change policy medium term large change interest rate significant impact economic activity risk consider low disrupt recovery process due interruption monetary easing balance risk copom understood adequate interrupt temporarily monetary easing way retain disinflation gain obtain endorse price increase sector benefit rebound demand contaminate overall inflation
thus copom decide eight vote one maintain target rate without bias
end meeting announce copom would meet february technical presentation following day order discuss monetary policy decision set communiqué october summary data analyze copom
