installed capacity utilization manufacturing industry reach september compare august accord cni data seasonally adjust bcb consider adjust data average installed capacity utilization september low period last year although difference revert margin thus august september level increase respectively compare month last year decline average utilization partially reflect improvement productive capacity fact recent data regard output absorption capital good suggest robust ongoing expansion investment year september absorption capital good expand mainly drive increase capital good import volume capital good production civil construction input expand accord comparison basis therefore despite ongoing aggregate demand expansion relevant aggregate supply imbalance anticipate come quarter stress previous copom minute inflation trajectory closely link current prospective development regard expansion supply adequately meet demand condition
trade balance continue present robust result confirm previous copom assessment regard important structural change brazilian external trade year october trade balance reach u billion level reach period last year result drive record result export u billion import u billion trailing surplus october reach u billion new record high result domestic demand recovery import outperform margin record new record high u billion accord comparison basis spite increase export also continue expand reach new record high u billion accord comparison basis consequence robust external result expect continue current account surplus stand u billion october reach u billion year gdp u billion surplus twelve month october gdp
regard international scenario uncertainty regard monetary policy stance u persist although additional interest rate increase discard consensus point fact bulk domestic interest rate increase may already happen hand concern fact monetary tightening cycle may excessive continue increase fear recession u economy potential implication brazilian economy however bear emphasize far limited effect less favorable international outlook observe last month concern state already present especially regard increase risk aversion low international liquidity fact may sovereign risk reach historically low level last month remain stable electoral process fact corroborate recurrent analysis express previous press release inflation report brazilian economy resilient external shock context copom reaffirm continued disinflation robust persistent trade surplus buildup international reserve adequate public sector primary surplus improve public sector debt profile buyback external debt strengthen domestic resilience external shock therefore copom continue assign low probability significant deterioration international financial market condition could affect brazilian external financing
another concern regard international outlook oil price also dampen oil price slightly decrease since last copom meeting nominal oil price remain historically high level addition oil price still present high volatility reflect among factor geopolitical tension worth mention dynamic observe last year reflect great extent structural imbalance oil market suggest permanent upward move oil price occur future oil price trajectory still encompass great uncertainty however scenario consider copom attribute change domestic gasoline price become likely occur risk relate materialization decrease significantly despite stability domestic gasoline price change international oil price affect domestic oil price instance productive chain petrochemical well deterioration market inflation expectation
assessment inflation trend
identified shock impact reassess accord newly available information scenario consider simulation utilize following assumption compare value consider octobert copom meeting projection gasoline bottle gas fixed line telephone price adjustment remain respectively consider comparison basis projection household electricity adjustment change copom maintain adjustment projection regulated price item accord weight release ibge represent total october ipca projection regulated price inflation decrease regulated price project apart consider information available projection regulate price continue base endogenous determination model model consider effect seasonal component exchange rate market price inflation igp projection spread selic rate use vector autoregressive model base selic swap rate eve meeting stand fourth quarter reach last quarter
regard fiscal policy assume consolidated public sector primary surplus target gdp achieve related assumption consider previous meeting maintain
since october copom meeting median ipca inflation expectation compile bcb investor relation group gerin increase increase mainly drive incorporation october inflation rate increase inflation expectation remain month ahead inflation expectation increase inflation expectation decrease mention previous minute development suggest consolidation favorable macroeconomic scenario
inflation forecast benchmark scenario assume maintenance selic rate exchange rate forecast period increase compare value consider october copom meeting remain target establish cmn year forecast base market scenario incorporate consensus exchange selic rate trajectory collect gerin eve copom meeting also remain value consider october copom meeting central target year hand projection accord scenario reduce relative october projection remain target scenario
monetary policy decision
copom reaffirm view monetary policy contain inflationary pressure consolidate favorable macroeconomic environment economic activity data still suggest low likelihood significant pressure inflation import expansion contribute significantly process complement domestic production therefore restrict potential inflationary effect domestic demand growth moreover despite prospect low liquidity international market due interest rate increase industrialized economy external outlook remain favorable particularly regard brazilian external financing therefore scenario inflation trajectory remain benign october meeting copom emphasize main challenge monetary policy context guarantee consolidation anticipated favorable development
copom evaluate inflation increase mainly drive expected upturn food price observe last month since effect deplete likely upcoming inflation indicator still capture increase due nature pressure expect temporary reduce intensity throughout time without necessarily contaminate horizon however copom continue conduct monetary policy stance gain obtain inflation control recent year become permanent materialize copom carefully monitor evolution inflation several core inflation measure upcoming month discriminate persistent generalized price increase promptly adapt monetary stance circumstance
preservation inflation rate line target path consolidation stable macroeconomic scenario contribute progressive reduction macroeconomic risk perception underway scope reduction real interest rate future naturally follow consequence improved perception copom evaluate cautionary monetary policy stance critical increase probability inflation convergence target path materialize however important look inflation indicator remain consistent recent benign inflation outlook observe last quarter
copom emphasize important lag monetary policy transmission economic activity inflation since beginning monetary easing cycle september selic rate reduce great part reduction concentrate consequently activity level completely mirror effect interest rate cut well effect economic activity resumption inflation completely materialize therefore evaluation alternative monetary policy stance necessarily concentrate prospect inflation risk associate materialization instead current inflation indicator
coming month employment income expansion credit growth continue bolster economic activity mention october copom minute activity level also reflect effect governmental transfer fiscal impulse occur since last quarter expect continue next year therefore effect interest rate cut add factor contribute demand expansion
give exist incentive expand aggregate demand uncertainty surround monetary policy transmission mechanism low distance current selic rate interest rate copom understood maintenance important achievement disinflation preserve economic growth job creation rise real income may demand cautious monetary ease stance argument even relevant light fact monetary policy decision coming month produce concentrated impact
give reason state copom consider convenience reduce selic target basis point copom member consensually conclude several factor would justify decision decision would contribute increase magnitude total adjustment implement however consensus low pace monetary easing start present meeting
three member copom vote reduction selic target consider current balance risk justifies decision however majority member copom emphasize information available present moment would justify change pace monetary easing process underway would necessary wait evolution macroeconomic outlook next meeting consider convenience reduce selic target basis point
therefore copom decide reduce selic target basis point without bias five vote copom monetary policy action three vote favor reduce selic target basis point
regime monetary authority decide accord inflation prospect analyze alternative scenario main variable determine price dynamic despite decrease international financial market volatility factor cause heighten volatility previous month still persist environment monetary authority must remain vigilant uncertainty contaminate long time horizon case exacerbation risk factor monitor copom monetary policy strategy promptly adapt circumstance
