international financial market volatility remain elevated significant change scenario consider copom july meeting adjustment chinese exchange rate regime occur without significant implication main global financial asset brazilian country risk fell close historic low reach october remain level brief time volatility brazilian country risk accompany similar volatility exchange rate liquidity condition financial market stability remain tie macroeconomic condition industrialized country especially united state feed potential monetary policy response economic development general recent indicator suggest favorable outlook sense fed continue raise interest rate measured pace additional point concern current account imbalance large economy possibility eventual adjustment result significant currency movement despite concern significant degree uncertainty copom continue assign low probability significant deterioration international financial market
main concern regard external scenario recent spike oil price recent deterioration reinforces concern international price could spike even high even moderate could remain level extended period time prior month oil price projection remain subject considerable degree uncertainty prompt copom maintain baseline scenario adjustment domestic fuel price copom maintain scenario give evidence speculative position likely drive recent oil price increase could reverse near term regardless possible specific geopolitical tension important emphasize since july meeting baseline scenario oil price outlook become increasingly implausible risk scenario mount could increase domestic gasoline price year addition independently occur domestic gasoline price international oil price trend continue represent risk future inflation path via effect product well private sector inflation expectation
august inflation expectation fell third consecutive month reflect large expect deceleration july ipca since july copom meeting median ipca inflation expectation decline increasingly line inflation objective ahead inflation expectation fall marginally recent week inflation expectation remain stable week fell slightly addition since june meeting progressive reduction average standard deviation distribution projection suggest increase optimism regard inflation outlook could see evidence inflation expectation long time horizon continue influence favorable development cool inflationary pressure include monetary policy stance improved market expectation exchange rate path mention prior copom minute development suggest monetary policy stance contain inflationary pressure contribute consolidation favorable macroeconomic environment
