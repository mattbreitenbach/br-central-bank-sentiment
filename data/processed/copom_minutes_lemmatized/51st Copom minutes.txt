prospective assessment inflation trend
base newly available information shock already identify impact economy analyze basic scenario found upon following hypothesis
august inflation high expect due time persistently high food price subgrouping household food supply register growth july august analysis various component subgrouping indicate temporary price shock effect dissipate september despite agricultural period could marginal impact inflation final quarter year consequently hypothesis increase food price final quarter revise downward
price international oil market remain highly volatile clearly reflect uncertainty respect real volume production speculation regard demand growth northern hemisphere winter season concern regard historically low level world stock petroleum derivative shortage petroleum derivative could generate added pressure current price despite fact structure future price indicate successive monthly decline one consider future market projection external petroleum price readjustment already introduce domestic fuel price basic scenario incorporate increase approximately internal price petroleum derivative final consumer reflect price index final quarter year
respect government manage price expect substantial pressure inflation occur july august remainder year basic scenario incorporate impact public transportation fare municipality yet authorize annual increase well electricity rate rio de janeiro hypothesis reflect average increase government manage price general direct impact percentage point hypothesis public service rate follow growth trajectory estimate general index use respective contract government manage price accompany median level price economy
respect external environment trajectory interest rate federal fund implicit future contract indicate current level per year maintain despite possible inflationary pressure cause petroleum price hypothesis world growth range come year maintain thus contribute continuity improvement balance trade international liquidity condition require finance current account deficit
hypothesis consider previous meeting maintain particularly regard primary surplus base target define fiscal policy gdp growth compatible equilibrium aggregate supply demand
base simulation perform basic scenario conclude current level interest rate per year would make possible comply inflation target project inflation slightly median point target due adverse supply shock fuel foodstuff affect economy second half year however effect shock dissipate rapidly since clearly temporary nature provoke significant alteration early figure month september point downward movement inflation would seem confirm less degree inertia price formation inflation project slightly target time alternative scenario consider additional increase domestic fuel price target would meet considerable ease
leading indicator inflation present together forecast lead indicator point steady reduction inflation rate november possibility marginal increase december year january nonstructural model also point direction inflation decline month september maintain projection monthly rate range december accumulated term year model point median ipca growth slightly
ipca core inflation also present figure remain monthly average first six month year increase july august pressure somewhat attenuate foodstuff register less high generate expectation downturn ipca core september core inflation measure consumer price index brasil calculate release fgv decline august follow level july august result quite close monthly average register first half year
accord daily banco central survey median expectation growth ipca increase since last meeting estimate revise estimate following year alter

monetary policy guideline
balance supply demand point absence imbalance would indicate significant inflationary pressure horizon relevant system inflation target pace economic activity growth remain solid well within parameter deem compatible price stability aggregate demand indicator strong great supply consumer credit growth export
highly positive fiscal result obtain course year confirm government commitment austerity stand guaranty compliance target set economic program fiscal situation steadily improve economic expansion make possible increase inflow time confidence economic agent brazilian economy increase become possible gradually lengthen maturity public debt security
lead durable consumer good capital good industrial output expand one result increase average utilization installed capacity labor market indicator point growth employment productivity significant impact production cost
external scenario gain relative importance term risk growth brazilian economy particularly light uncertainty surround petroleum price however international economic condition would seem generally favorable brazil recent indicator reflect great confidence relation hypothesis smooth slowdown united state economy time future market would seem discard possibility change american interest rate coming month growth perspectives seem improve japan remain solid euro zone despite downturn value common currency situation positive impact brazilian export contribute improvement perception risk emerge nation general
however international oil price still climb volatility forecasting somewhat futile exercise highly adverse price shock show u time come probability new high increase winter northern hemisphere approach tendency future market point direction price decline though average price expect remain high level forecast year
overall situation judge consistent compliance inflation target significant change comparison analysis carry previous meeting measure ipca inflation month august slightly high estimate formulate market banco central however consider result temporary upturn foodstuff one stress unexpected transitory increase alter expectation responsible price formation point generate significant secondary impact inflation low level inertia note wake final quarter would seem repeat even though economy whole clearly strong growth trajectory
incorporate diverse forecasting instrument available copom information contain recent indicator result new upward revision value expect inflation light aforementioned supply shock inflation year probably close level somewhat well within tolerance band leeway exist precisely purpose make possible manage type shock also take measure aim avoid spread area economy inflation turn downward coming month accumulate value close slightly target however price performance closely monitor order confirm hypothesis underlie conclusion
light copom decide maintain selic rate target per year
close meeting announce base schedule ordinary copom meeting release banco central communiqué date committee would meet october pm technical presentation following day pm order discuss monetary policy guideline
