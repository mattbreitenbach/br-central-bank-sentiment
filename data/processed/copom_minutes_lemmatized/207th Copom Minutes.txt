committee understand give estimate extension pace monetary ease depends stage cycle without necessarily reflect change baseline scenario balance risk
member copom agree evolution economy since april copom meeting meeting compatible reduction selic rate percent
hence member committee discuss next step monetary policy assess pace ease would recommend next meeting whether early signaling possibility would advisable analysis regard appropriate pace ease involve consideration inflation activity projection estimate extension cycle current stage risk surround scenario estimate include associate prospect reform adjustment economy regard convenience signal one hand argue uncertainty regard evolution baseline scenario inflationary disinflationary current one balance risk recommend conjecture possible pace adopt future hand need moment provide guidance element reduce uncertainty scope possibility regard future course monetary policy highlight copom member conclude moderate reduction pace monetary easing appropriate next meeting nevertheless also emphasize pace continue depend evolution economic activity balance risk possible reassessment extension cycle inflation forecast expectation
committee member emphasize environment anchored inflation expectation would allow copom focus prevent effect relative price adjustment may occur time apply favorable food supply shock positive dynamic price industrial good also potential inflationary relative price adjustment copom understand seek identify primary effect relative price change monetary policy react monetary policy focus possible effect adjustment might contribute change inflation projection expectation
member committee emphasize approval implementation reform notably fiscal nature adjustment brazilian economy include relate credit policy nature fundamental sustainability disinflation full operation monetary policy reduction structural interest rate widespread benefit society
