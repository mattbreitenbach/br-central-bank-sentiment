economi activity
indicator level economic activity show sign cooling evidence mainly evolution consumption indicator last two month trend shall accentuate next month result impact electrical energy ration initial effect deterioration expectation new planning future expenditure much part consumer company reflect next result economic indicator productive sector restriction electrical energy shall reflect among others reduction growth rhythm observe mainly industrial sector
among demand component consumption one reveal strong loss dynamism data relate total sale commerce consumer expectation indicate behavior retail segment survey ibge national level show fall real invoicing commerce year march register growth january comparatively equal period previous year data trade federation state são paulo fcesp show growth april january consultation credit protection service spc telecheque city são paulo also present waning sign number consultation service fell april seasonally adjustment reduce accumulated growth year april march
performance retail activity reflect consumer perception consumer intention index metropolitan region são paulo release fcesp drop may april drop attribute internal political crisis deterioration external scenario since survey encompass expectation beginning may index yet reflect negative impact cause energy crisis
regard default rate information trade association são paulo acsp show net rate discount cancellation new register record spc reach april register month previous year april growth average net rate default relation number check return insufficiency fund number cleared check
financial system credit indicator still clearly suggest cool activity level credit operation free segment register growth april oppose march performance associate large extent behavior credit destine company whose activity relate exchange rate show growth balance operation company referred modality exclude operation present evolution month oppose march
way growth april oppose march operation individual suggest still high growth demand personal credit acquisition good despite deceleration response increase lend rate april daily average concession new credit category personal credit acquisition good register fall respectively
supply side encompassing data refers march reflect period strong expansion economic activity gdp register growth first quarter encourage mainly performance industrial sector largely influence mine industry transformation industry shall highlight manufacturing segment use installed capacity accord survey fundação getulio vargas reach april year oppose april result compare growth sector observe last year reveals part expansion investment
dynamism first month year reflect part good performance export explain high level import april trade balance present significant growth export increased shipment beef soy grain soy bran due plant health measure european country manufactured good performance remain similar last month mainly export product link automobile industry deserve special mention fuel export item gain importance since end result strategy aim swap oil product surplus country
import also keep performance last month largely due maintenance industrial growth responsible rise expense acquisition important item capital good raw material intermediate good increase auto import equally significant result trade agreement rise import originate asian country
sign gradual accommodation economic indicator mainly demand one would jeopardize desired expansion economic activity year contrary slowdown would beneficial economic environment improve price performance excessively impact agricultural price trade balance however one consider future perspectives give energy crisis
implication first moment refer deterioration expectation unfolding flow expense credit perspective intensification process consumption deceleration since may mainly relation good whose sale involve future income commitment consider longer horizon cooling consumption conditional magnitude effect crisis income job level
regard credit slowdown volume new concession expect short term fall medium term behavior conditional increase lend rate bank spread imminence augmented risk default additionally demand credit much consumption investment might affect evolution income
industrial segment operate high level compare previous year energy crisis imply reduction pace expansion however possibility transfer energy consumption sector tend reduce impact ration manufacturing moreover process rationalization substitution energy source intensification electric energy shall contribute objective must observe process well absence accurate sectoral coefficient relation various segment make difficult precisely quantify impact ration industrial production
light even manufacturing strongly affect rationing electric energy might cause contraction export well import export basic product shall significantly affect much use relatively less electricity industrialized one fact substantial part exportable production occurs outside rationing area among main product export metallurgical product intensively use electric energy nevertheless company energy generation likely however exportable surplus reduce manufacture production might suffer direct impact low energy supply also reduced supply raw material intermediate good domestically produce might replace import input
regard import fall acquisition raw material intermediate good expect reduction however attenuate substitution domestic supply import good similar way reduction capital good import might offset part necessity substitute energy generate equipment speed required investment overcome energy crisis fuel lubricant import reduction due contraction economic growth might mitigate necessity substitute electric energy energy generate oil product therefore export import shall impact cut due ration reduction activity level
finally regard price behavior immediate effect refers impact surcharge energy bill household already estimate around percentage point june ipca shall highlight effect opposite end process indirect impact rationing shall consider one hand restrictive perspective supply consequent rise cost hand contraction consumption flow investment tend minimize price pressure
price
april price index continue affect factor observe march main responsible inflation period food product especially animal origin index also pressure exchange rate movement last month
inflation increase april due mainly food price behavior latter consequence draught loss bean crop well domestic effect expanded meet export along impact wheat product exchange rate depreciation
ipca accumulate year month variation april result influence contribution percentage point tradable good milk bean poultry bread among product natura food responsible percentage point domestic employee contribute percentage point case administered price increase energy cost water sewer charge compensate reduction alcohol gasoline price
record variation april accumulate increase year month breakdown april following ipa increase ipc incc regard ipa shall stress acceleration farm price contribute expansion agricultural product price industrial product item also pressure item food ipc register increase april ipc core raise april accumulate month
near future drop agricultural price expect behavior administered price impact inflation result give among factor surcharge electric energy bill previously expect increase electricity tariff increase bus fare city são paulo increase telephone tariff june
external environment
international economy remain deceleration due performance united state stagnation japan rise spot future price oil remain key concern regard inflation path context international monetary fund imf may report reduce growth forecast world output october latin america brazil uncertainty regard economic financial difficulty argentina add economic deceleration process
united state deceleration economic activity growth lead monetary authority promote successive reduction basic interest rate total basis point may rate reach consumer credit whose variation february lower march industrial production register contraction seventh consecutive month record variation april hence accumulated variation twelve month reduce march april deceleration sign also remarkable labor market unemployment rate reach april amount job opening drop unit month first official estimate indicate gdp annualized growth first quarter compare expansion last quarter seasonally adjust series output growth decelerate relation quarter previous year reach quarter compare last quarter annual inflation rate consumer producer record moderate increase april reach respectively
european central bank bce reduce minimum reference interest rate percentage point may response low activity growth euro area downward trend inflation towards nevertheless harmonized price index ipch register monthly variation respectively february april raise annual rate last two month
argentina government seek revert negative expectation regard overall economy country aggregate demand industrial output remain low level supermarket shopping center sale march grow respectively compare period previous year monthly industrial estimator march record contraction seasonally adjust imply accumulated variation twelve month fiscal result first quarter total deficit u billion high period spite substantial increase march april interest rate gradually decrease may result news debt swap interest rate may transaction peso dollar transaction april order revert less favorable financial market expectation government implement fiscal measure reduce deficit u billion among measure increase tax rate financial transaction u million cut public expenditure third revision agreement imf conclude increase u billion fiscal deficit target half order correct deviation original target quarter year conclusion third revision allow disbursement u billion financial package agree december additionally argentine government commit complete debt swap process lengthen maturity internal external debt

prospective assessment inflation
identify shock impact reassess light newly available information scenario consider simulation base following hypothesis
april inflation rate stay upper limit expectation due increase following item food beverage domestic employee electrical energy variation three component account almost equivalent full change monthly headline index
international price oil increase since last meeting maintain high volatility daily price consider implicit price schedule future brent petroleum contract average year around u per barrel
projection electric energy price adjustment remaining year raise include surcharge levy household energy bill effective june adjustment public transportation also reassess take consideration increase bus fare city são paulo whose weight index substantial group administered price include fuel energy public transportation telecommunication total expect adjustment represent direct contribution percentage point year inflation
observed reduction agricultural price initial week may justify change underlying hypothesis food price behavior variation group price expect second quarter revert strong increase observe april
expect fed fund rate remain current level end
external scenario assume recent elevation brazil risk premium tend remain stable following quarter assumption equivalent upward shift brazil risk curve compare last meeting project trajectory
electrical energy shock initially model typical supply shock reduce growth rate pressure domestic price also consider temporary shock impact revert
hypothesis consider previous meeting maintain particularly one attain primary fiscal surplus target first quarter gdp growth adjust accord data release ibge

monetary policy guideline
strong economic activity beginning context growth deceleration observe economy trading partner influence level import grow fast pace export hence pressure exert current account balance financing requirement balance payment negative impact exchange rate series particularly unfavorable event domestic external scenario add environment among argentine crisis domestic political instability recently announcement energy supply limitation three five country geographical region event contribute maintain exchange rate pressure since variable immediately respond risk perception economic agent magnitude recent exchange rate depreciation make difficult least potentially keep consumer price inflation low rate
heating aggregate demand observe accompany domestic credit expansion last month although economic indicator suggest contraction aggregate demand margin yet case credit operation fact credit volume loan banking system increase
april suggest positively slopped interest rate yet produce full expect reduction loan despite moderate increase default level return check overall quality financial institution asset affect
increase uncertainty since last meeting large extent result announced restriction energy consumption whose consequence yet assess desired accuracy clear however impact aggregate supply severe give initially expect magnitude duration reduction energy consumption characterize supply shock
principle shock shall reduce rapidly quantity supply good service quantity demand tend lead inflationary pressure low gdp growth rate however trivial task adequately quantify effect repercussion instance fall supply depend upon capacity economy adjust new environment mean energy substitution electricity rationalization usage besides domestic demand fall pace supply probable exceed demand could match import lead price increase inevitable initial reduction output growth tend countervail inflationary pressure time restore supply demand equilibrium hand aggregate demand strongly affect deteriorated expectation inflation trade balance would less affected output
monetary policy shall seek neutralize secondary effect energy ration inflation particularly whose impact felt primary consequence shock limit direct impact price index high energy cost also encompass expected change relative price good service due downward shift supply tend raise index secondary effect include eventual propagation movement generate initial price increase fight avoid offsetting relative price change would turn lead additional price adjustment
besides energy shock relevant change economic scenario since last copom meeting shall take account external scenario uncertainty remain despite sign improvement case argentina attention remain focused swap short term debt long term instrument situation change june settlement detail make public united state new reduction basis point basic interest rate tend improve global liquidity condition growth outlook world economy favor continuity adequate external financing current account balance even context low direct investment flow
internal scenario april inflation high expect consequence food price increase agricultural product substantial price increase explain currency depreciation case beef poultry whose export raise strong external demand also case wheat product initial week may however improvement weather condition crop make available market place lead substantial reduction food price
trajectory core inflation calculate mean method show reduction april although level still high estimate administered price change revise upwards mainly due adverse evolution international price oil moreover relevant factor underlie revision temporary surcharge levy household energy bill increase public transportation bus fare city são paulo take together administer price shall percentage point impact inflation
sum brazilian economy face several simultaneous adverse shock whose net effect inflation need identify sign demand slowdown observe since increase interest rate deterioration expectation opposite direction potential inflationary impact continued exchange rate depreciation energy shock yet occur
copom conclude persistence exist pressure inflation probable secondary effect energy crisis recommend reinforcement monetary policy realign expected inflation trajectory establish target mainly
consequently copom unanimously decide increase selic rate target
close meeting announce committee would meet june pm technical presentation following day pm order discuss monetary policy guideline set calendar copom ordinary meeting publish central bank communiqué
