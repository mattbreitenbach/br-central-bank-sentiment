global environment continue mark prospect global growth next year easing covid policy china milder winter europe possibility gradual decline u growth soften expect global economic slowdown come quarter due tightening financial condition major economy
inflationary environment remain challenging recent data suggest moderation margin several country normalization supply chain accommodation price major commodity recent period lead moderation inflationary pressure conversely low degree labor market slack economy associate high current inflation high degree inflation diffusion suggest inflationary pressure service sector last longer
process normalization monetary policy advanced economy continue towards restrictive rate synchronize across country tighten financial condition impact economic growth expectation period high interest rate foreseen process increase interest rate call great caution conduct economic policy also emerge economy

committee decide emphasize horizon horizon refer inflation projection stand committee judge uncertainty assumption projection high usual
committee analyze alternative scenario stable interest rate throughout entire relevant horizon scenario copom inflation projection stand
committee evaluate different assumption parameter scenario discussion inflation projection subject member evaluate possibility incorporate increase neutral interest rate towards movement observe inflation expectation extract focus survey committee choose point maintain neutral interest rate evaluate alternative scenario identify impact projection increase neutral rate grow time become relevant second half
copom assesses scenario prospective global growth look little less challenge result change china covid policy mild winter europe member emphasize economic activity labor market data remain relatively resilient u china adjustment sanitary restriction lead cyclical recovery demand reduction risk supply disruption however committee assess chinese growth expect remain low observe period reflect adjustment real estate sector worsened demographic expect come year europe milder winter also reduce likelihood extreme scenario energy supply u economic activity data point deceleration still environment pressured labor market despite development committee continue assess commitment determination central bank reduce inflationary pressure anchor expectation consolidate global scenario tightening financial condition long period rate end tighten cycle maintain sufficiently long period contractionary level raise risk pronounced global deceleration
committee continue assess process global disinflation especially regard core inflation indicator challenge possibly happen slowly usually observe since inflation widespread service segment however member highlight deceleration measure core inflation several country
data economic activity brazil continue indicate moderate pace marginal growth employment data suggest loss dynamism member observe movement towards partial recomposition recent real wage loss judge movement expect couple deceleration nominal gain expect intensify ahead committee continue monitor labor market release continuously assess role lagged inflation labor market pressure wage adjustment set release data include drop confidence indicator deceleration credit grant together lagged effect monetary policy reinforce committee expectation slowdown pace economic activity worsen come quarter
committee note particular concern deterioration inflation expectation deterioration may happen several reason among possible perception banco central brasil bcb leniency target set national monetary council cmn expansionary fiscal policy pressure aggregate demand projection horizon possibility change inflation target already set
first case bcb reaffirm commitment conduct monetary policy achieve establish target assesses deanchoring observe necessary remain even vigilant conduct monetary policy reanchor expectation thus reduce future cost disinflation
second case committee considers demand stimulus assess view stage economic cycle degree slack economy monetary policy macroeconomic adjustment variable use mitigate inflationary effect fiscal policy
finally regard third case bcb conduct monetary policy base target set cmn summary important analyze motivation rise expectation committee emphasize act ensure inflation converge target
committee also discuss impact fiscal scenario inflation discussion emphasize net effect conduct fiscal policy inflation dependent prevailing macroeconomic financial condition thus analyze multiple channel include movement financial condition arise future interest rate update assumption fiscal path incorporate sanctioned budget committee assess scenario activity change significantly member note median projection questionnaire pcq focus survey primary deficit much low estimate federal budget possibly incorporate fiscal package announce ministry finance copom sustain usual governance incorporate policy already sanction law acknowledge implementation propose fiscal package could reduce upside inflation risk
committee emphasize risk scenario remain direction among upside risk inflationary scenario inflation expectation emphasize great persistence global inflationary pressure ii still heighten uncertainty country future fiscal framework fiscal stimulus support aggregate demand partially incorporate inflation expectation asset price iii output gap tight one currently adopt committee reference scenario especially labor market among downside risk note additional reduction price international commodity measure local currency ii great project deceleration global economic activity iii continuity tax cut assume reverse
current scenario particularly uncertain fiscal side inflation expectation drift away inflation target long horizon call great attention conduct monetary policy committee judge scenario raise cost disinflation need reach target establish cmn scenario copom reaffirm commitment set monetary policy meet target
discussion conduct monetary policy
copom discuss conduct monetary policy consider set projection evaluate well balance risk inflation
committee decide emphasize horizon projection anticipate next quarter resume adopt usual horizon accord calendar year since ahead horizon coincide calendar year direct effect tax change usual horizon
committee begin debate evaluate whether previously outline strategy stable interest rate would sufficient convergence inflation target purpose copom analyze main determinant inflation trajectory behave recently
start output gap deceleration economic activity credit recently labor market observe expect committee give monetary policy lag regard member stress deceleration continue necessary monetary policy channel act inflation converge target also note economic growth prospect change significantly recent period
service inflation moderate remain level compatible target committee focus service inflation since respond inflationary inertia economic activity directly factor expect put less inflationary pressure horizon case dimension continue call attention committee continue evaluate speed convergence process take place
balance risk global inflationary pressure ease still high uncertainty deceleration inflation process tend linear risk likely persist long tight labor market observe several advanced economy concern domestic risk two set risk intersect fiscal issue firstly fiscal framework revision reduce visibility public account come year introduces premia asset price impact inflation expectation secondly concern fiscal stimulus copom continue monitor impact economic activity inflation reinforces environment narrowed output gap impact inflation tends outweigh desired impact activity member note implementation ministry finance fiscal package mitigate fiscal risk consider important monitor challenge implementation finally risk output gap persists committee continue assess data model thorough understanding
regard downside inflation risk international commodity price local currency reduce committee assess risk sharp slowdown global economic activity remain horizon despite risk degree reduce china reopening process regard committee continue monitor one hand process withdrawal fiscal monetary stimulus advanced economy hand chinese reopening process
regard inflation expectation committee note concern recent movement long horizon addition direct impact rise expectation inflation projection rise expectation raise cost disinflation require great participation monetary policy channel consequently wider output gap obtain fall inflation committee remain vigilant persist anchoring expectation consolidate
copom projection rise due increase administered market price among preponderant factor increased projection rise focus survey inflation expectation stand projection condition assumption reference scenario show convergence target relevant monetary policy horizon introduction extended monetary tightening alternative scenario generate relevant impact projection toward convergence target
copom chose maintain interest rate reinforce need evaluate time cumulative impact observe intense timely monetary policy cycle already undertaken therefore committee assess give data release inflation projection expectation balance risk lagged effect monetary policy already significantly contractionary territory appropriate maintain interest rate level committee reinforce necessary remain vigilant assess strategy maintain selic rate long period reference scenario enough ensure convergence inflation
committee emphasize persist disinflationary process consolidates inflation expectation anchor around target show deterioration long horizon since previous meeting committee emphasize hesitate resume tightening cycle disinflationary process proceed expect
monetary policy decision
consider assessed scenario balance risk broad array available information copom decide maintain selic rate committee judge decision reflect uncertainty around scenario prospective inflation even variance balance risk consistent strategy inflation convergence level around target throughout relevant horizon monetary policy include large degree without compromise fundamental objective ensure price stability decision also imply smooth economic fluctuation foster full employment
committee remain vigilant assess strategy maintain selic rate long period reference scenario enough ensure convergence inflation committee emphasize persist disinflationary process consolidates inflation expectation anchor around target show deterioration long horizon since previous meeting committee reinforce future monetary policy step adjust hesitate resume tightening cycle disinflationary process proceed expect
