conclude economic activity remain low level due slow process start end first quarter year recent outcome might indicate possible reversal trend show particularly consumption index still incipient yet incorporate fully effect international crisis therefore one draw conclusion start new trend addition shape expectation coming month decision carmaker reduce output incorporate well impact decision sector industry
slow demand due low credit expansion drop consumer confidence offset effect energy crisis aggregate supply generate output gap contain inflationary pressure improve trade balance mainly mean reduction import view difficulty international environment expand export
external environment
data release last month show economy slow trend since second half even attack september regard capital spending remain decline reduction output capital good stability order factory data evolution consumption suggest consumption slow retail sale decline september compare previous month seasonally adjust reduction accumulated growth month august context consumer credit increase u billion september remain downward trend term month growth rate

summary process slow economy already affect industrial country negative impact emerge economy mostly within area influence tend exacerbate consequence september attack delay therefore start economic recovery

prospective assessment inflation
identify shock impact reassess light newly available information scenario consider simulation encompass following hypothesis
september inflation rate measure ipca record low expect
projection price oil compute base term structure price imply brent crude oil future contract expectation average price barrel dated brent substantially reduce u fourth quarter assume price oil price domestic market show important reduction compare assumption substantial rise make last copom meeting
wider set administered price expected adjustment reduce october september
projection adjustment electricity price remain approximately
slope domestic yield curve measure difference term di rate selic rate project average basis point fourth quarter decline linearly average basis point last quarter
path fed fund rate project base maturity future contract indicate reduction rate end first quarter stability thereafter
external front assumption average risk premium revise incorporate decline path current level plateau near basis point second quarter
gdp growth second quarter modify reflect revision make ibge compare period previous year
core inflation ipca calculate symmetric method remain stable september accumulate month core index increase core inflation calculate symmetric method decline september accumulate month core increase inflation core calculate exclusion administered price consider wide set weigh ipca september household food price increase august accumulated variation month
median market expectation ipca inflation survey central bank daily basis revise upwards

relation fiscal policy assume primary surplus target consolidated public sector meet state economic program government

monetary policy guideline
industrial production august show sign accommodation economic activity level low one register beginning year result decelerate trend start first quarter deceleration imply asymmetric decrease use factor production one hand capacity utilization industry lower various region country fall fifth consecutive month hand employment indicator indicate stability number job opening august period increase march may year likewise seasonally adjust open unemployment rate present slight reduction august
accentuated reduction capacity utilization may reflect lagged reaction employment pace economic activity effect energy crisis alternatively stability employment may indicate slow economy perceive temporary possibility reinforce consumption indicator signal slight recovery august september strong reduction previous quarter could point possible reversal trend
however consumption indicator incipient incorporate fully impact international turmoil mainly september incident consumer remain cautious indicate index consumer intention october face tight credit condition reduce real income deteriorate external scenario industrial production sustain placement order particularly deal energy crisis addition prospect coming month draw decision carmaker reduce production consider well impact sector industry therefore effect several shock economy particularly recent event united state premature conclude recovery level activity
uncertainty external scenario increase recently industrial country response incident september united state slowdown consumption observe notwithstanding drastic cut interest rate make major central bank financial asset market remain volatile sharp fall observe week follow september event capital flow respond negatively event decrease flow international trade project result low level activity world economy argentina difficulty remain sovereign risk premium reach level high week election october brazil deterioration external scenario concern capital flow put pressure exchange rate positive side oil price may respond slow growth demand remain level significantly low observe year
inflation expectation measure median response survey central bank raise recently reach plateau considerably high copom since expectation may interpret indicator actual projection make price wage setter brazilian economy recent rise might indicate future pressure price fact entrepeneurs expectation indicate poll seem reflect intensely current difficulty pass cost increase price
compare analyst expectation copom projection three relevant factor consider first inflation expectation survey tend consider additional depreciation exchange rate copom considers exchange rate level day meeting methodological reference period projection risk additional depreciation may cause passthrough price increase projected inflation year next relevant horizon factor may contribute directly stabilize exchange rate instance recent measure take reduce liquidity financial system low demand hedge company seek protection liability exposure exchange rate risk sense low volatility exchange rate tends minimize defensive behavior moreover improvement trade balance current account may indicate increasingly trend towards large permanent supply resource foreign currency increase confidence brazilian economy sustainable growth come year
second analyst projection consider high passthrough recent accumulated depreciation price next year copom considers risk depreciation pass price depend demand level see empirical evidence inflation report september therefore copom evaluation slow demand due lower credit expansion low consumer confidence offset energy crisis effect aggregate supply produce output gap whose effect may contain inflation pressure moreover copom use selic rate constant projection period methodological reference median analyst projection considers gradual reduction rate
finally analyst believe high inflation shall put pressure inflation next year important observe however increase inflation year due primarily combination adverse shock would necessarily persist coming month solid evidence small inflation inertia brazilian economy recent year projected fall inflation fourth quarter year high level third quarter reinforce assumption
copom remain alert high risk additional passthrough price expect level inflation inertia brazil copom understands however monetary policy adequate meet inflation target next year conclusion contemplate external uncertainty demand stability level low expect early year associate still unclear prospect economic recovery may limit possibility passthrough exchange rate inflation
accordingly copom unanimously decide maintain selic rate target
closing meeting announce committee would meet november pm technical presentation following day pm order discuss monetary policy guideline set calendar copom ordinary meeting publish central bank communiqué
