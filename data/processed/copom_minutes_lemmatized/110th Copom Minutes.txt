monetary policy decision
ipca inflation fell second consecutive month june rise january april contraction june reflect deflation regulated tradable good price well low inflation register since october good june deflation result favorable confluence two atypical event regulate price fell due drop fuel price especially fuel alcohol market price stable due strong drop food price especially perishable food
core ipca inflation decelerate june measure monitor copom exclusion trim mean smooth smoothed trimmed mean measure measure decelerate least reflect implicit inertial component continue post high month cumulative value core inflation exclusion decelerate even though exclude item register large price drop june regulate price household food item trimmed mean core inflation present least variation last twelve month deceleration last two month core inflation measure begin approach level compatible target path
june posted deflation second consecutive month june drop primarily due fall wholesale price contract faster drop industrial price slow decline agricultural price decline wholesale price index also reflect reduction consumer manufactured good price occur despite modest increase consumer durable good price data second period july suggest deceleration pace industrial agricultural price contraction overall throughout second quarter evidence consistent accommodation wholesale price positive implication consumer price coming month emphasize prior copom minute intensity continuity depend prospective demand condition expectation future inflation path
industrial production rise may seasonally adjust term significantly expectation derive lead coincident industrial indicator thus industrial production reach new record level achieve december also register third consecutive monthly increase accumulate growth period basis industrial production rise consecutive monthly increase stable move average series also show significant increase may three month relative stability lead coincident indicator series suggest industrial production expand similar pace june
industrial category grow may consumer durable good post high growth follow capital good category recover decline register april similarly category moving average series industrial activity increase suggest generalized expansion criterion capital good production post high growth reverse downward trend throughout year sector like consumer durables sustain strong growth sector lose dynamism
recent labor market data maintain favorable performance observe recent quarter unemployment rate measure ibge survey drop may low level year april two percentage point value post may number employed individual rise term term period hand drop real payroll average income potentially associate high expect increase inpc price index manufacture employment rise may measure national industry confederation cni seasonally adjust bcb continue growth trajectory begin first quarter real manufacturing payroll rise cumulative increase year formal employment measure ministry labor employment mte also continue rise creation job june formal employment generation total almost one million new position despite deceleration expansion economic activity recent quarter
retail sale rise may accord ibge data seasonally adjust bcb cumulative increase similar industrial activity furniture household appliance post large expansion retail sale also rise moving average term three consecutive decline reach record level similar post beginning year consumer confidence index rise july relative june month
may instal capacity utilization manufacturing sector measure cni seasonally adjust bcb rise last month capacity utilization trend sideways suggest potential accommodation historically elevate level despite expansion industrial production period context inflation trajectory depend capacity current prospective supply increase meet demand condition capital good absorption expand cumulative year may despite considerably high comparison base strong investment expansion capital good absorption show strong pace growth margin drive mainly increase capital good production well increase net capital good import capital good production rise year may end may consolidation recovery investment appear likely performance aggregate supply come quarter remain key concern regard inflation dynamic
achievement record high trade surplus june reinforce favorable outlook external account year accumulated trade balance reach u billion exceed median market expectation u billion twelve month june export grow value term relative period import expand reflect part rise oil price despite fact commodity share total import diminish export import grow high rate first half year margin appear sign cool pace growth strong performance trade account first six month year contribute current account surplus u billion period equivalent gdp
international financial market condition remain volatile improvement scenario consider june meeting brazilian country risk fell domestic currency appreciate nevertheless liquidity condition financial market stability remain tie macroeconomic condition industrialized country especially united state feed potential monetary policy response economic development additional point concern current account imbalance major economy possibility eventual adjustment result significant currency movement despite concern significant degree uncertainty copom continue assign low probability significant deterioration international financial market
oil price spike fell sharply albeit still high level day precede copom meeting increase level volatility oil price occur response new information demand condition potential supply restriction among producer country inventory data main consumer country prior month oil price projection remain subject considerable degree uncertainty prompt committee maintain baseline scenario assume adjustment domestic fuel price nevertheless recent increase international oil price translate increase domestic fuel price international oil price continue represent risk future inflation path via potential effect product well private sector inflation expectation despite recent reduction international oil price continue represent important risk future inflation path
significant reduction second consecutive month median ipca inflation expectation drop largely reflect deceleration ipca inflation june addition expectation inflation appear influence favorable development cool inflationary pressure improved market expectation exchange rate path restrictive monetary stance expectation ahead ipca inflation also fell recent week less degree inflation expectation ipca expectation remain stable mention prior copom minute development suggest monetary policy stance contain inflationary pressure contribute consolidation favorable macroeconomic environment
inflation forecast benchmark scenario assume maintenance selic rate exchange rate forecast period decline relative june inflation report forecast remain inflation objective year improvement primarily due low expect inflation result june exchange rate appreciation forecast base market scenario incorporate consensus exchange rate selic rate trajectory eve meeting remain benchmark scenario also fell relative june inflation report forecast benchmark scenario inflation forecast rise slightly remain central target establish national monetary council forecast market scenario also increase remain central target
committee also analyze inflation forecast period end march june september forecast period responsive current monetary policy decision calendar year also reliable calendar year forecast benchmark scenario twelve month end march june september next year target inflation path value interpolate objective target
committee reaffirm view express prior copom minute effect interest rate tighten cycle begin september reflect inflation result look inflation forecast economic activity continue expand pace compatible supply condition exert significant inflationary pressure addition committee see improvement external scenario despite continuation international oil price high level therefore definite sign emergence benign inflation scenario context monetary policy shift toward ensure consolidation favorable development anticipate future
copom determine maintain interest rate level establish may sufficiently long period time would create condition necessary assure inflation convergence target path committee therefore unanimously decide maintain selic target unchanged without bias clearly change inflation scenario monetary stance quickly adapt circumstance
conclusion meeting announce copom would reconvene august technical presentation following day discuss monetary policy decision establish communiqu√© october summary data analyze copom
