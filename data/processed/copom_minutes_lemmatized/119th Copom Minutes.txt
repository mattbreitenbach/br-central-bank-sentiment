external environment change significantly since april meeting volatility increase markedly sizable portfolio shifting take place consequent upon uncertainty timing magnitude ongoing u tighten cycle short run instability impact many currency well emerge market risk premium intermeeting period exchange rate go per u dollar brazilian sovereign risk measure emerge market bond index plus increase basis point copom member see instability likely phenomenon moreover sound fundamental brazilian economy contribute weather storm consistent inflation reduction robust trade surplus adequate primary fiscal surplus international reserve accumulation domestic public debt profile improvement buyback external sovereign debt noticeable progress country resilience shock evidence unabated growth performance face u interest rate adjustment cycle copom continue assign low probability significant deterioration international financial market condition one could measurably affect brazilian external financing condition

monetary policy decision
copom reaffirm view current expected inflation number demonstrate monetary stance adopt since september contain inflationary pressure consolidate favorable macroeconomic environment economic activity gain momentum pace consistent supply condition trigger significant inflationary pressure spite continued volatility international financial market due uncertainty regard monetary policy developed country record high reach oil price external outlook remain favorable particularly regard brazilian external financing condition benign inflation environment continue prevail despite likely reversal favorable factor subdue inflation increase risk stem important commodity price april meeting committee emphasize main challenge monetary policy ensure consolidation favorable development
uninterrupted convergence inflation target path result consolidation long lasting macroeconomic stability contribute progressive reduction perceived macroeconomic risk process already underway several year wide scope reduction real interest rate future naturally follow copom considers cautious monetary policy stance critical increase probability inflation convergence target path materialize however important inflation indicator remain consistent current benign inflation outlook
copom emphasize important lag monetary policy transmission economic activity inflation since start monetary easing cycle september committee reduce selic rate basis point activity level completely mirror effect interest rate cut effect recent activity resumption inflation fully materialize
coming month employment income expansion credit growth continue sustain economic activity mention april minute activity level also reflect effect new minimum wage fiscal impulse last quarter first half consequently effect interest rate cut add factor also contribute demand expansion
give uncertainty surround monetary policy transmission mechanism narrowed gap current selic equilibrium rate copom understands preservation important achievement disinflation economic growth along job creation rise real income may demand cautious monetary stance argument even relevant light monetary policy decision come month produce impact concentrate
committee member therefore unanimously decide continue monetary easing process begin september meeting reduce selic target rate without bias closely follow evolution macroeconomic scenario next meeting time define next step monetary policy strategy
inflation target framework authority make decision take account project inflation use alternative scenario macroeconomic variable impact price dynamic even consider recent increase international market volatility probably transitional nature consequence heighten uncertainty associate future inflation may well impair authority ability evaluate scenario private sector expectation coordination hence monetary policy must remain vigilant uncertainty fee horizon potentially high risk affect currently benign prospective scenario policy strategy promptly adapt eventually new circumstance
