last month convergence inflation expectation trajectory inflation target play key role generate positive inflation result monetary policy guide basic interest rate order ensure expectation consistent convergence inflation target median market inflation expectation roughly stable since august copom meeting inflation market expectation decrease regard expectation inflation next twelve month slight increase market expectation stable
copom evaluate risk projection inflation trajectory ongoing basis risk become less significant doubt regard degree inertia inflationary peak last quarter last quarter year copom observing wage readjustment occur collective bargaining agreement important differentiate two type readjustment sector relative price gain since last year notably sector tradables benefit exchange rate depreciation ii base past inflation rather project current performance sector
disinflation process continue risk become important consecutive reduction rate since june real interest rate come closer run level consistent sustainable growth price stability basic interest rate approach level great relative importance risk associate uncertainty monetary policy transmission mechanism include lag magnitude impact change rate inflation progressive change relative importance risk gradualism conduct monetary policy become increasingly important
projection inflation next twelve month target market expectation stable consistent targeted path exchange rate external account present source inflationary pressure copom believe appropriate continue process monetary policy easing decide unanimously fix rate target
