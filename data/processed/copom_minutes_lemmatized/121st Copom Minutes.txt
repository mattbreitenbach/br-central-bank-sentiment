installed capacity utilization manufacturing industry increase second consecutive month june may accord cni data seasonally adjust bcb first half year average installed capacity utilization stand level register period although difference marginally decrease decline partially reflect improvement productive capacity fact recent data regard output absorption capital good civil construction input suggest expansion investment example year june absorption capital good expand compare period main driver result increase capital good import volume capital good production civil construction input expand accord comparison basis therefore despite favorable prospect aggregate demand expansion relevant supply unbalance anticipate come quarter stress previous copom minute inflation trajectory closely link current prospective development regard expansion supply adequately meet demand condition
trade balance continue present robust result confirm previous copom assessment regard important structural change brazilian external trade year july trade balance reach u billion level reach period last year trailing surplus july reach u billion previous month slightly u billion record high reach march despite trade surplus remain elevated level process already expect suggest start new adjustment dynamic trade flow even trailing export july reach u billion new record high series similarly import also continue outperform reach new record july u billion accord comparison basis consequence robust external result expect current account surplus stand u billion july record high series u billion surplus twelve month july gdp
regard international scenario bear emphasize interruption monetary policy tighten cycle u seventeen consecutive interest rate increase despite fact additional increase discard uncertainty regard monetary policy stance u much weak hand concern long monetary tightening cycle increase fear recession u economy
deterioration international scenario last month especially regard high risk aversion low international liquidity limit influence domestically fact may sovereign risk reach historically low level last day fact corroborate recurrent analysis express previous press release inflation report brazilian economy resilient external shock context copom reaffirm continued disinflation robust persistent trade surplus accumulation international reserve adequate public sector primary surplus improve public sector debt profile buyback external debt strengthen domestic resilience external shock improvement domestic resilience shock reflect evidence domestic economy sustain growth trend despite long monetary adjustment process course u euro zone japan therefore copom continue assign low probability significant deterioration international financial market condition could affect brazilian external financing
another concern regard international scenario oil price despite decline observe since last copom meeting oil price remain elevated level stand level observe end addition oil price still present high volatility reflect geopolitical tension however current scenario might reflect structural unbalance oil market oil price might face temporary increase may resist elevated level longer previously expect previous month future oil price trajectory still encompass great uncertainty significant downturn price seem less likely occur short run therefore mention last copom minute scenario consider copom attribute change domestic gasoline price become less likely occur consequently risk relate materialization increase significantly shall trend recently observe materialize copom may incorporate benchmark scenario increase domestic oil price addition apart effect increase domestic fuel price elevation international oil price affect domestic economy productive chain petrochemical well deterioration market inflation expectation
assessment inflation trend
inflation shock ands impact reassess accord newly available information scenario consider simulation utilize following assumption compare value consider july copom meeting projection gasoline bottle gas price adjustment remain respectively consider comparison basis projection fixed line telephone household electricity adjustment remain respectively copom maintain adjustment projection regulated price item accord weight release ibge represent total july ipca accord endogenous determination model projection regulated price inflation decrease model consider effect seasonal component exchange rate market price inflation igp projection spread selic rate use vector autoregressive model base selic swap rate eve meeting stand third quarter reach last quarter last quarter

monetary policy decision
copom reaffirm view monetary policy contain inflationary pressure consolidate favorable macroeconomic environment economic activity data still suggest expansion line supply condition next quarter low likelihood significant pressure inflation moreover despite prospect low liquidity international market due interest rate increase industrialized economy oil price swing historically high level external outlook remain favorable particularly regard brazilian external financing therefore even take account part favorable result inflation tend revert future scenario inflation trajectory remain benign july meeting copom emphasize main challenge monetary policy context guarantee consolidation anticipated favorable development
uninterrupted convergence inflation target path result consolidation durable macroeconomic stability contribute progressive reduction macroeconomic risk perception underway scope reduction real interest rate future naturally follow consequence perception improvement copom evaluate cautionary monetary policy stance critical increase probability inflation convergence target path materialize however important look inflation indicator remain consistent recent benign inflation outlook
copom emphasize important lag monetary policy transmission economic activity inflation since beginning monetary easing cycle september selic rate reduce great part reduction concentrate consequently activity level completely mirror effect interest rate cut well effect recent activity resumption inflation completely materialize
coming month employment income expansion credit growth continue bolster economic activity mention july copom minute activity level also reflect effect new minimum wage fiscal impulse occur since last quarter expect rest therefore effect interest rate cut add factor contribute demand expansion
give reason state copom consider convenience reduce selic rate basis point despite consider several factor would justify decision copom member conclude present moment basis point reduction selic rate would good response current monetary condition improve inflation outlook observe july august meeting light fact copom unanimously decide continue monetary policy ease process begin september meeting reduce selic rate target without bias follow evolution macroeconomic scenario next meeting time define next step monetary policy strategy
give exist incentive expand aggregate demand uncertainty surround monetary policy transmission mechanism low distance current selic rate interest rate copom understood maintenance important achievement disinflation preserve economic growth job creation rise real income may demand cautious monetary ease stance argument even relevant light fact monetary policy decision coming month produce concentrated impact
regime monetary authority decide accord inflation prospect analyze alternative scenario main variable determine price dynamic despite decrease international financial market volatility factor cause heighten volatility may still persist environment monetary authority must remain vigilant uncertainty contaminate long time horizon case exacerbation risk factor monitor copom monetary policy strategy promptly adapt circumstance
