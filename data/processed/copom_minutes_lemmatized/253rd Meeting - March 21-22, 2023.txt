update economic outlook copom
since previous meeting monetary policy committee copom global environment deteriorate episode involve bank united state europe increase uncertainty volatility market require monitoring major economy emphasize principle separation objective instrument conduct monetary macroprudential policy
time recent data global activity inflation remain resilient process monetary policy tighten major economy continue advance external environment continue mark prospect global growth potential easing covid policy china milder winter europe possibility gradual u growth slowdown soften ongoing global economic slowdown result tightening financial condition major economy conversely impact financial condition consequently global growth recent episode involve banking system major economy still uncertain negative bias recent inflation reading point stabilization core inflation several country level target reinforce inertial nature current inflationary process inflationary environment remain challenge low degree labor market slack economy couple persistently high current inflation high degree diffusion suggest inflationary pressure particularly service sector last longer
process normalization monetary policy continue towards contractionary rate synchronize across country several emerge economy tighten cycle come halt suggest near end case monetary authority signal prolonged period high interest rate necessary fight inflationary pressure call great caution conduct economic policy also emerge country
turn brazilian economy set indicator release since previous meeting still corroborate scenario slowdown growth expect committee moderation observe coincident indicator activity credit market also show deceleration margin labor market surprise positively throughout continue show sign moderation relative stability unemployment rate stem decline employed population workforce
consumer inflation remain high inflation component sensitive economic cycle monetary policy present great inflationary inertia remain range compatible meet inflation target inflation expectation collect focus survey around respectively
scenario risk analysis
reference scenario interest rate path extract focus survey exchange rate start evolves accord purchase power parity ppp committee assume oil price follow approximately future market curve following six month start increase per year onwards moreover energy flag assume yellow december
scenario copom inflation projection stand inflation projection administered price
committee decide emphasize horizon ahead horizon refer third quarter inflation projection stand committee judge uncertainty assumption projection high usual
committee analyze alternative scenario stable interest rate entire relevant horizon scenario inflation projection stand third quarter
committee assess possibility incorporate increase estimate neutral interest rate towards movement observe expectation long term extract focus survey real neutral interest rate rate absence impact factor inflation rate remain stable output grow accord potential reflect productivity gain change structural fundamental economy point committee decide keep neutral interest rate evaluated alternative scenario identify impact increase neutral rate projection grow time become relevant second half
assess factor could lead unfold alternative scenario characterize high neutral interest rate emphasis place possible adoption expansionary parafiscal policy increase neutral rate reduce power monetary policy previously remark committee
committee continue assess global disinflation process especially regard underlying inflation indicator challenge may slow usually observe inflation widespread service segment context reduction inflationary pressure continue require commitment determination central bank control inflation prolonged tightening financial condition determination likely impact upon asset price short term contribute credible lasting global disinflationary process
since previous copom meeting regional bank liquidate u two large swiss bank merge raise concern banking system major economy committee continue closely monitor situation analyze possible contagion channel assess direct impact domestic financial system emerge country far limited change stability efficiency financial system
scenario therefore look even challenging conduct monetary policy increased risk around inflationary scenario relation financial stability one hand episode involve banking sector consequent need provide liquidity hand global growth inflation data remain resilient require commitment determination monetary authority committee believe best contribution monetary policy continue combat inflationary pressure smooth economic fluctuation addition member emphasize see dilemma conduct monetary policy objective inflation control objective financial stability committee stress two objective specific instrument
brazilian activity data continue indicate moderate pace growth margin employment data suggest moderation point period strong recovery last two year process deceleration growth begin durable good sector particularly buoyant pandemic sensitive interest rate policy deceleration spread good sector subsequently service sector although milder way copom continue evaluate economic slowdown underway necessary guarantee convergence inflation target particularly prolonged period inflation target finally note economic growth outlook change significantly recent period
expect give great lag relation economic cycle recently labor market show evidence moderate slowdown compatible committee expectation moderation pace economic activity member observe movement towards partial recomposition recent loss real wage movement expect accompany deceleration nominal gain expect intensify ahead
committee believe disinflation dynamic continue characterize process two distinct stage first stage already complete great speed disinflation great effect administered price indirect effect market price less inertia second stage currently observe speed disinflation slow core inflation affected aggregate demand interest rate policy reduce slow pace respond output gap inflation expectation thus observe inflationary dynamic drive excess demand initially good currently shift service sector therefore require moderation economic activity monetary policy channel act process demand serenity patience conduct monetary policy convergence inflation target
deterioration inflation expectation focus survey especially long maturity much debate point behavior expectation fundamental aspect inflationary process since affect setting present future price wage high inflation project ahead company worker start incorporate future inflation adjustment price wage thus great rise price current period inflationary process feed expectation also highlight anchoring expectation key factor price stability therefore follow best international practice committee incorporate expectation making process analyze include one factor affect inflation projection
additional tightening credit condition observe modality member believe movement line expect consider interest rate rise undertake middle second half member increase delinquency slowdown credit granting still expect line observe previous monetary policy tighten cycle member contrast assess recent period tightening credit granting intense expect focus specific market committee believe bcb appropriate necessary liquidity instrument link macroprudential policy address localized relevant friction system occur furthermore reinforce monetary policy appropriate act manner aggregate demand
committee also discuss impact fiscal scenario inflation regard copom emphasize net effect fiscal policy conduct inflation highly dependent current macroeconomic financial condition copom evaluate ministry finance commitment implementation fiscal package already identify fiscal statistic reinstatement fuel tax smooth fiscal stimulus demand reduce upside risk inflation furthermore committee continue monitor elaboration discussion implementation fiscal framework present government vote national congress copom emphasize mechanical relationship convergence inflation presentation fiscal framework since former remain conditional reaction inflation expectation public debt projection asset price nevertheless committee stress materialization scenario solid credible fiscal framework might result benign disinflationary process effect expectation channel reduce inflation expectation economic uncertainty risk premium domestic asset
committee emphasize risk scenario remain direction among upside risk inflationary scenario inflation expectation emphasize great persistence global inflationary pressure ii uncertainty fiscal framework impact expected path public debt iii large persistent deanchoring inflation expectation among downside risk note additional reduction price international commodity measure local currency ii great project deceleration global economic activity particularly due adverse condition global financial system iii slowdown domestic credit grant large would compatible current stance monetary policy
one hand recent reinstatement fuel tax reduce uncertainty fiscal result short term hand current scenario mark high volatility financial market deanchored inflation expectation target require attention conduct monetary policy committee judge deanchoring inflation expectation raise cost disinflation need reach target establish national monetary council scenario copom reaffirm commitment set monetary policy meet target
discussion conduct monetary policy
copom discuss conduct monetary policy consider set projection evaluate well balance risk inflation
committee decide emphasize horizon projection anticipate next quarter committee use usual horizon since horizon ahead coincide calendar year direct effect tax change usual horizon
copom start debate evaluate whether previously outline strategy stable interest rate would enough ensure convergence inflation towards target end committee continue process analyze main determinant inflation path behave recent period significant change occur prospective scenario output gap deep debate take place effect possible project credit tighten economic activity service inflation inflation core increase resilience low speed observe recent release line process already anticipate copom addition inflation expectation follow deanchoring process partially relate question likely change future inflation target committee evaluate credibility pursued target fundamental component inflation target regime contributes proper functioning expectation channel make disinflation quicker less costly regard decision induce reanchoring expectation would reduce disinflationary cost uncertainty associate process
change copom inflation projection primarily affect change expectation previous meeting finally balance risk debate one hand great deanchoring inflation expectation long term hand abrupt reduction domestic global credit grant affect economic activity copom emphasize monetary policy conduct moment require serenity patience incorporate inherent delay inflation control interest rate therefore reach goal relevant monetary policy horizon
lastly committee reinforce harmony monetary fiscal policy reduce distortion uncertainty facilitate disinflationary process foster full employment time regard committee reinforce importance public private credit granting remain competitive interest rate sensitive selic
monetary policy decision
consider assessed scenario balance risk broad array available information copom decide maintain selic rate committee judge decision consistent strategy inflation convergence level around target throughout relevant horizon monetary policy include large degree without compromise fundamental objective ensure price stability decision also imply smooth economic fluctuation foster full employment
take account uncertainty scenario committee remain vigilant assess strategy maintain selic rate long period enough ensure convergence inflation committee emphasize persist disinflationary process consolidates inflation expectation anchor around target show additional deterioration especially long horizon committee reinforce future monetary policy step adjust hesitate resume tightening cycle disinflationary process proceed expect
