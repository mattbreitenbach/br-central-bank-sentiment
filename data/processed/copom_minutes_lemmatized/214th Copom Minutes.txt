discussion conduct monetary policy
committee member discuss evolution economic activity light available data agree pace economic activity soften margin movement occur amidst process consistent recovery albeit gradual pace brazilian economy context committee member believe economic activity recovers inflation tends gradually return target reaffirm view result current level slack economy marginal revision intensity recovery would lead material revision expected path inflation
regard global outlook committee consider scenario become challenging risk fast normalization interest rate advanced economy induce change asset price volatility financial condition international market baseline scenario comprise gradual normalization monetary policy central economy dependent prospective path price wage inflation economy committee member also mention geopolitical risk risk associate continued expansion international trade possible impact global growth context copom member highlight brazilian economy capacity withstand setback international scenario give robust balance payment low inflation environment anchor expectation prospect economic recovery nevertheless copom ponder risk derive possible continuation reversal outlook emerge economy context frustration expectation regard necessary reform adjustment brazilian economy context consider evolution global outlook produce relative price change impact monetary policy circumscribe effect inflation price economy directly affect shock
copom analyze inflation trajectory throughout current subsequent year member agree inflation development remain favorable several measure underlie inflation run still low level include component sensitive business cycle monetary policy also discuss extent trajectory compatible convergence inflation target relevant horizon conduct monetary policy one hand persistence underlie inflation measure low level pose downward risk prospective inflation path hand recovery economic activity still expect contribute bring underlying inflation towards target relevant horizon additionally risk associate continuation reversal outlook emerge economy context frustration expectation regard necessary reform adjustment brazilian economy still remain copom judge recent evolution dimension whole mitigate risk delayed convergence inflation towards target
committee member also discuss conditional projection inflation different scenario scenario interest exchange rate extract focus survey projection show slight decrease compare projection produce time march copom meeting scenario constant interest exchange rate detail paragraph minute projection around slightly level observe aforementioned scenario copom see level comfortable take account current balance risk deem odds inflation remain target relevant horizon diminish
committee reaffirm understanding anchored inflation expectation face occasional shock lead change relative price monetary policy focus effect copom highlight reaction possible change relative price symmetrical monetary policy follow principle whether face inflationary shock case external shock lead devaluation exchange rate face disinflationary shock case favorable food price shock
establish monetary policy react shock induce change relative price copom member discuss extent rate brazilian economy conclude intensity depends several factor level slack economy degree anchoring inflation expectation committee decide monitor different measure inflation underlying inflation
copom member reaffirm understanding economic condition anchored inflation expectation underlie inflation measure low level inflation projection target slightly target high level slack economy prescribes accommodative monetary policy interest rate structural interest level although estimate rate imply high degree uncertainty committee member express view current real interest rate provide stimulus economy time contribute convergence inflation target
copom understand process reform necessary adjustment brazilian economy contribute reduction structural interest rate committee continue reassess estimate rate time
committee member discuss evolution baseline scenario balance risk since march meeting meeting appropriate monetary policy decision light evolution
firstly evaluate alternative reduce basic interest rate percentage point order mitigate risk delayed convergence inflation towards target factor favor alternative namely low level inflation underlying inflation gradual pace recovery economy recent softening assess alternative keep selic rate favor option weigh change balance risk inflation due external shock reduce chance inflation remain target relevant horizon possible effect inflation make unnecessary mitigate risk overly slow convergence inflation target weigh baseline scenario balance risk committee conclude decision keep interest rate current level appropriate
member also evaluate fact recent communication copom member appear interpret public indicative decision reduce interest rate end understanding prevail focus best possible decision give set information available time result time great credibility monetary policy
committee discuss possible interpretation economic agent monetary policy would react mechanically recent exchange rate development committee member understand may impact external shock brazilian economy emphasize essential understand monetary policy react impact automatically since implication monetary policy depend shock may transmit expectation inflation projection balance risk
context copom state focus monetary policy effect inflation propagation price economy directly affect shock context anchored inflation expectation effect tend mitigate high level slack economy
committee also emphasize communication reaffirm conduct monetary policy exclusive focus evolution inflation projection expectation balance risk economic activity external shock tackle secondary impact may prospective inflation context committee conclude absence mechanical relationship external scenario monetary policy evident time already make explicit copom official communication
base assessment copom member agree maintain selic rate also decide indicate next meeting comfortable inflation projection current balance risk committee deem appropriate maintain interest rate current level
committee reaffirm preference communicate conditionality evolution monetary policy well transmit economic rationality guide decision contribute increase transparency improve copom communication context member reaffirm next step conduct monetary policy continue depend evolution economic activity balance risk inflation projection expectation
committee member emphasize approval implementation reform notably fiscal nature adjustment brazilian economy fundamental sustainability environment low stable inflation full operation monetary policy reduction structural interest rate economy widespread benefit society
finally copom stress importance initiative aim productivity increase efficiency gain great flexibility economy improvement business environment effort fundamental resumption economic activity development brazilian economy
monetary policy decision
take account baseline scenario balance risk wide array available information copom unanimously decide maintain selic rate committee judge decision reflect recent change balance risk prospective inflation consistent convergence inflation target relevant horizon conduct monetary policy include great extent
committee reiterate economic condition prescribe accommodative monetary policy interest rate structural level
copom emphasize evolution reform necessary adjustment brazilian economy contribute reduction structural interest rate committee continue reassess estimate rate time
copom assessment evolution baseline scenario mainly balance risk make unnecessary ease monetary policy order mitigate risk delayed convergence inflation toward target regard next meeting committee deem appropriate maintain policy rate current level copom emphasize next step conduct monetary policy continue depend evolution economic activity balance risk inflation projection expectation
