monetary policy decision
copom reaffirm view express previous minute addition contain inflationary pressure monetary policy also contribute significantly consolidation favorable term macroeconomic environment economic activity data indicate intensity demand expansion increase probability important pressure inflation addition investment expansion import growth remarkably contribute slow process complement domestic production therefore limit potential inflationary effect stem aggregate demand sustain growth moreover despite uncertainty regard continuity strong growth international economy volatility increase global market since last copom meeting prospect brazilian external financing forecast period suggest accord newly available information balance payment may present risk inflation scenario therefore even increase uncertainty inflation prospect remain line target trajectory recent meeting copom emphasize main challenge monetary policy context guarantee consolidation positive development anticipate future
copom evaluate emerge local inflationary pressure likely represent risk domestic inflation trajectory heated demand increase wholesale price consumer price inflation additionally heat domestic demand trigger inflationary pressure tradable sector copom also observe increase ipca inflation expectation twelve month ahead despite level target establish process must carefully monitor sense copom continue manage monetary policy stance gain obtain inflation control recent year become permanent respect copom carefully monitor evolution inflation several core inflation measure discriminate persistent generalized price increase promptly adjust monetary policy stance circumstance
preservation inflation rate line target path consolidation stable macroeconomic scenario contribute progressive reduction macroeconomic risk perception underway scope reduction real interest rate future naturally follow consequence improved perception copom evaluate cautious monetary policy stance critical increase probability inflation convergence target path materialize however important look inflation indicator particular expected dynamic aggregate demand supply remain consistent recent benign inflation outlook observe last quarter
copom emphasize important time lag transmission monetary policy stance economic activity inflation since beginning monetary easing cycle september selic rate already reduce bulk reduction concentrate last nine month consequently activity level completely mirror effect interest rate cut yet well effect economic activity inflation completely materialize therefore evaluation alternative monetary policy stance necessarily focus prospective inflation scenario risk instead current inflation indicator
coming month employment income expansion credit growth continue bolster economic activity despite current inflation acceleration increase market interest rate mention recent copom minute activity level also reflect effect governmental transfer fiscal impulse expect next quarter year consequently lagged effect interest rate cut increasingly robust aggregate demand add factor continue contribute expansion issue become even relevant consider clear sign heated aggregate demand fact monetary policy decision limit effect predominant impact
pace domestic demand may continue sustain factor impulse derive monetary policy ease implement year may still bring risk inflationary dynamic conversely last development suggest contribution external sector consolidation benign inflationary scenario may become less effective
