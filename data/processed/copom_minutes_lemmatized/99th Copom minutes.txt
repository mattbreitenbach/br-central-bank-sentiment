quarterly fgv industrial survey report capacity utilization july close historical peak reach first quarter level idle capacity vary heterogeneously among sector july july capital good industry increase capacity utilization approach historical peak consumer good industry perform similarly raise capacity utilization compare historical peak hand capacity utilization intermediate good industry remain flat period range average historical peak interval much narrow sector heterogeneity even clear data disaggregated industrial subsector subsectors close historical high others yet reach average level series start
capital good absorption domestic production plus net import continue expansionary trend compare first half year period capital good absorption grow consolidation trend crucial economy broaden growth potential stage however particularly difficult project output gap environment sharp expansion demand observe last quarter
export still expand fast pace accumulate increase first half year compare first half period total import grow import grow reflect strong recovery domestic demand trade balance accumulate u billion surplus first seven month year current account register u billion surplus period evidence economy may grow previously expect weak inflationary pressure lessen risk fast monetary tightening federal reserve consequence market volatility diminish last week contribute maintenance brazilian sovereign risk basis point exchange rate oscillate around july average appreciate around eve copom meeting
oil price main concern external front recent trend reinforce fear oil price may reach persist long period time high level one recently consider likely scenario even reversion relation recent hike occurs copom projection increase gasoline price maintain enough eliminate gap domestic international price consider crude oil around u per barrel benign scenario sustain due diagnosis part recent volatility oil price due speculative factor may dissipate even presence geopolitical risk however since last copom meeting balance risk regard oil price increase risk may cause increase gasoline price great lag domestic international price correct moreover regardless evolution domestic gasoline price increase international oil price transmit domestic economy partly intermediate productive chain petrochemical also deterioration inflation expectation private sector
deterioration market inflation expectation initiate may continue since last copom meeting median ipca expectation increase median expectation next twelve month decrease main reason happen lie fact inflation expectation july low one july median inflation expectation remain steady albeit mean standard deviation surveyed sample increase somewhat clear evidence pessimistic sentiment private sector regard inflation
copom inflation projection benchmark market scenario slightly increase compare last month impact cause combination high market inflation expectation increase project regulated price offset effect inflation projection cause increase yield curve benchmark scenario projection base unchanged exchange rate throughout projection horizon respectively point inflation rate target target stress projected deviation relation target much low one project market scenario take account consensus exchange rate eve copom meeting project inflation rate one benchmark scenario target since consider reduction rate depreciated exchange rate copom also assess third hybrid scenario consider unchanged rate exchange rate path expect market compare market scenario inflation projection identical slightly
previous meeting committee also analyze inflation projection next month correspond second half first half project inflation period benchmark market scenario stand interval central inflation target
strong continuous economic rebound already reach historical high require extra caution conduct monetary policy aim preserve balance aggregate supply demand level capacity utilization rapidly increase approach historical record sector recent data capital good domestic absorption civil construction activity indicate fix capital investment recover however period reversion economic activity cycle fast expansion follow slow erratic growth pattern last year natural high degree uncertainty regard speed growth productive capacity sector whose current level capacity utilization already high also regard potential growth trend scenario fast increase aggregate demand fundamental carefully assess risk eventual narrowing output gap
previous meeting member stress maintenance current rate long period would consolidate favorable inflation scenario convergence actual inflation rate inflation target however monetary authority admit active policy stance could adopt inflation projection deviate target due eventual deterioration underlying factor lead increase inflation projection member understand since last meeting two factor enhance risk could jeopardize accomplishment inflation target first one increase oil price possibility high longer rise oil price previously project accompany adjustment monetary policy could produce effect incompatible regime second factor partially consequence increase oil price deterioration inflation expectation steady time scenario consolidated yet copom cautious new development factor
even inflationary scenario require adjustment rate future important reiterate impact sustainable growth process brazilian economy contrary monetary policy contributes growth fight effect supply shock promote balance expansion aggregate demand broadening economy productive capacity moreover sustain inflation path consistent inflation target essential preserve real earnings fundamental continuous balanced expansion domestic demand dissemination economic growth benefit population
consider reason state committee decide unanimously maintain target rate without bias
