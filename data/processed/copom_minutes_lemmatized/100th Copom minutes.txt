recent evolution inflation
august broad national consumer price index ipca rise july ipca fall mainly due low impact tariff pressure july ipca electricity fix telephone hand bad weather condition affect price fresh food rise price sugar cane also affect inflation include indirect impact gasoline price brazil alcohol fuel add gasoline ipca accumulate change first eight month year variation twelve month
general price index rise august compare july thus accumulate change first eight month year acceleration august due high pressure wholesale consumer level consumer price index brazil rise wholesale price index rise respectively july national index civil construction incc weight rise july august incc accumulate change respectively
alcohol fuel gasoline main individual contribution august ipca inflation food price rise july account monthly ipca change mainly due increase fresh food price surge sugar cane price lead price increase crystal sugar refine sugar conversely important product consumer basket register new price fall august include rice black bean soy oil
august market price increase july account monthly ipca variation increase regulated price responsible remain among market price pressure come contribute ipca change noticeably fresh food maid housekeep cleaner tradable price contribute mainly due increase price sugar new car regard regulated price addition price increase gasoline residual effect increase electricity fix telephone price urban bus fare already pressure ipca july
acceleration august reflect rise agricultural industrial price increase july due price raise vegetable fruit sugar cane pork cereal crop continue present price decrease increase july mainly due acceleration price iron steel plastic material paper cardboard mechanic electrical material wood rubber
wholesale industrial price except fuel accumulate change period end august period industrial product except fuel ipca register average increase therefore significant potential lagged impact consumer price next month due wholesale industrial inflation
august ipca core inflation measure exclude household food item regulate price register variation july accumulate change year twelve month smoothed ipca core stand july total year last twelve month without smoothing procedure item core record july year twelve month
core inflation calculate get√∫lio vargas foundation fgv symmetric method stand august july accumulate year last twelve month
september inflation decline mainly due low pressure regulate price fresh food price however uncertainty stem gap wholesale consumer industrial inflation persist likewise scenario international oil price remain uncertain constitute potential risk domestic inflation

monetary policy decision
ipca deceleration august july due low pressure regulated price market price rise mainly increase fresh food price market price inflation average per month exactly figure register august april variation stay thus market price inflation remain systematically level consistent inflation target set year since may accumulated change month tradable regulated price ipca show upward trend regard wholesale inflation increase august july similarly happen past recent acceleration industrial wholesale price shall impact consumer inflation next month intensity depend final demand condition
ipca core remain relatively stable high level period core measure exclude household food item regulate price accumulate annualized rate considerably low headline index difference reflect substantial contribution regulated price food inflation period even exclude noticeable source pressure consumer inflation period annual change signal underlie trend consistent inflation target path year august core exclusion still headline inflation ipca core also remain high annualized change smooth period respectively accumulate first eight month
economic activity continue gather momentum accord brazilian institute geography statistic ibge gdp grow first half compare period lead manufacturing trade sector seasonally adjust gdp grow three quarter row annualized rate july industrial production continue upward trend grow june seasonally adjust quarterly moving average industrial production seasonally adjust series grow continuously since february since may series previous record high even high level present vigorous increase june july three month end july expansion compare period end april
labor market continue respond activity rebound accord ibge unemployment rate fell july third consecutive month stand despite unfavorable seasonality unemployment rate return level december considerably low register july level employment follow upward trend since january growth july seasonally adjust level formal employment accord ministry labor employment increase july first seven month year job create period compare period respectively
accord monthly employment survey ibge upward trend real payroll initiate january accelerate june july however average real earnings grow slow pace reflect increase job relatively low wage negotiation wage readjustment first half year favorable recovery labor income department statistic socioeconomic study dieese inform negotiation result readjustment inpc inflation readjustment equal accumulate inpc even readjustment equal past inflation average real earnings tend increase future inflation decline comparatively past inflation current perspective negotiation second half year highly favorable recovery labor income
recovery real earnings important source sustainability expansion aggregate demand paramount continuation economic rebound balanced disseminated way mention minute copom meeting july good whose sale less sensitive credit sensitive income show accelerate growth trend mainly consequence recovery labor market negative performance output semi good july seasonally adjust decline relation june seem indicate reversion trend particular late result reflect negative performance pharmaceutical product sector attributable labor income dynamic oppose positive result several economic activity strongly dependent income
industrial production surpass historical high level important concern monetary policy capacity productive sector accommodate demand expansion accord fgv industry present relatively low level idle capacity july sector installed capacity utilization close historical peak information corroborate national industry confederation cni data accord level industrial capacity utilization reach july seasonally adjust historical record important notice idle capacity reduce gradual effect inflation dynamic even production beyond exist limit marginal cost increase emergency measure multiple shift production import would competitive normal market condition may able avoid shortage would mitigate price pressure inherent progressively high level capacity utilization
initial monetary impulse lose momentum economic recovery process begin sustain mechanism natural sound margin production sale growth rate decelerate even natural sound deceleration take place situation growth rate average unusually high even initial stage cyclical recovery aggregate production level overcome previous historical high even though industry growth rate decline since may late result still show rather robust growth rate
recent indicator interpret evidence pronounced deceleration progress spontaneous fashion despite fact difficult identify turn point volatile series one regard level economic activity industrial sale fell july accord seasonally adjust data cni exchange rate appreciation contribute result nominal export revenue brazilian reais decrease package paper shipment fell august accord data corrugate paperboard association abpo seasonally adjust bcb however decrease interpret caution follow extraordinary increase previous month inversely important coincident indicator still grow august case vehicle steel production spite plausible spontaneous accommodation fact course way data confirm beforehand accommodation trend intense enough rule concern potential gap supply demand well effect inflation dynamic give current level production
recent data suggest fix capital investment recover encouraging way accord national account measure ibge gross fixed capital formation grow second quarter good performance first four quarter previous cyclical rebound last year domestic absorption capital good capital good output plus net import grow june july good first month three previous cyclical rebound historical series gross fix capital formation show naturally high degree correlation installed capacity utilization lag sovereign risk performance lead indicator confirm room expansion fix capital investment next month although investment particularly promising since beginning current growth cycle pace output recovery also intense usual give room uncertainty concern speed output gap close
external transaction export expand period january august relation period previous year import also increase strongly period trade balance current account register surplus u billion u billion respectively january august period january june manufactured exported volume grow regard primary product increase exported volume accompany increase price far import concern durable good volume rise raw material intermediate good increase sharp response strong domestic demand
recent data indicate growth pace economy slow inflation remain subdue consequence intense hike interest rate become less likely contrast tension second quarter year international financial market remain calm favorable environment facilitate financing brazilian external need positive effect brazil exchange rate appreciate first ten day september august
international oil price hand continue source concern even though price fall historical record august oil price remain high much sensitive threat large exporter supply capacity important emphasize though exist lag domestic international gasoline price temporarily mitigate deviation international price gasoline crude oil mention august copom minute inflationary risk associate oil restrain domestic gasoline price also encompass oil intensive product
inflation expectation collect gerin deteriorate since last copom meeting median ipca increase eve august meeting expectation ipca deterioration affect mean standard deviation distribution finally affect median increase august next month median market expectation fell september august mainly due exclusion relatively high inflation expectation incorporation low expect inflation rate although deterioration expectation trigger exchange rate depreciation second quarter reinforce concern oil price reversion trend depend recent exchange rate appreciation eventual favorable scenario oil price also development domestic demand condition inflation result along incoming month
copom projection inflation rate change substantially since last meeting benchmark scenario market scenario case projected inflation target projection make benchmark scenario previous meeting already point inflation rate target however projection revise upwards due incorporation great readjustment regulated price next year instead market scenario project inflation rate one benchmark scenario thus inflation target assume slight reduction rate exchange rate depreciation throughout projection horizon
fact several inflation index overcome central target set national monetary council cmn affect mean inflationary inertia mechanism inflation rate inertia hit regulated price due readjustment clause base past inflation market price whose formation depend partially future inflation expectation partially past inflation copom estimate indicate inflationary inertia would impact inflation rate absence monetary response copom understand flexibility regime allow inertia fully fight single year way promote smooth transition inflation target medium run similarly strategy adopt past committee understand fight third referred inertia temporarily accommodate remain two third decision mean monetary policy instrument calibrate order pursue inflation rate correspond central target set cmn plus relate partial accommodation inflationary inertia inherit
even though procedure employ copom estimate inflationary inertia similar one use past calculate inertial component adjusted inflation target committee understand current circumstance recommend adjusted target procedure entirely reproduce particular system adjusted target allow besides anticipated decision partially accommodate inertia inherit previous year new adjustment throughout year incorporation primary effect certain shock increased stability brazil allows monetary conduct guide predetermined objective inflation restrict central target set cmn plus partial accommodation inflationary inertia establishment objective moment due fact monetary policy effect economic activity inflation within lag therefore require adjustment due anticipation obtain desired effect
important underline copom interpret objective inflation rate judicious exercise flexibility represent tolerance interval establish cmn around central inflation target remain unaltered fact monetary policy objective inflation rate central target even beginning year suggest new shock may affect inflation dynamic treat asymmetrically therefore copom even less tolerant relation shock may increase inflation objective time benefit eventual favorable shock opportunity bring actual inflation close target path set cmn
copom member agree current monetary stance maintain unchanged strong economic expansion would spontaneously accommodate pace consistent convergence inflation path inflation projection committee confirm increase risk inflation could deviate target particular projection already point inflation rate objective assumption rate maintain throughout projection horizon underlie inflation trend capture several core measure relatively steady level inconsistent target additional risk inflation deterioration market inflation expectation indefinite outlook global oil market potential pressure increase wholesale industrial inflation environment favor profit margin include one stem wage readjustment tend increase average real earnings
copom member consensually conclude best stance initiate process moderate adjustment monetary policy instrument due exist time lag implementation monetary policy effect economy central bank necessarily act preventive way contemporary data attests inflation control excessive demand pressure fact consider prospective scenario economy throughout long period monetary stance aim avoid risk materialize current data already confirm inflation rate control excessive demand pressure monetary policy response would different one consider committee
moderate adjustment aim promote convergence inflation target path already incorporate objective ipca adjust activity recovery medium long run inflation target copom avoid drastic measure future order disinflate economy eventual significant damage economic growth cycle sense monetary adjustment main final objective provide condition long run sustainable growth
another consensual agreement evaluation adjustment come gradual way differently shock treatment recommend crisis episode face brazil past five member copom conclude percentage point increase selic rate would adequate initiate adjustment process make smooth possible minimize initial turbulence risk three member vote increase accord evaluation would well signal magnitude overall adjustment require bring inflation back target path would better correspond optimal speed implementation adjustment process
therefore copom decide vote increase rate target without bias
closing meeting announce copom would meet october technical presentation following day discuss monetary policy decision establish communiqu√© october summary data analyze copom
