assessment inflation trend
inflation shock impact reassess accord newly available information scenario consider simulation assume following hypothesis projection readjustment gasoline bottle gas price remain unchanged projection readjustment household electricity fix telephone price also unchanged respectively increase regulated price represent total weight december ipca project line previous meeting projection readjustment regulated price follow model endogenous determination take account seasonal component exchange rate market price inflation change stand projection spread selic rate follow specification vector autoregressive model base swap rate eve copom meeting decline basis point first quarter basis point last quarter
regard fiscal policy assume consolidated public sector primary surplus target gdp achieve related assumption consider december copom meeting maintain

monetary policy decision
ipca inflation stand december well market consensus accelerate third consecutive month acceleration occur across three component tradable regulated price increase regulated price notably fuel continue put pressure inflation household food price reverse downward trend observe recent month cease contribute low inflation nonetheless ipca inflation accelerate december even exclude household food price
ipca inflation accumulate increase upper limit tolerance interval set national monetary council also inflation register market price increase increase regulated price average prior year therefore market price contribute regulated price contribute remain annual inflation correspond rate respectively market price regulated price responsible ipca respectively hence contribution market price inflation increase additionally reduction ipca due drop market price inflation due lower regulated price inflation
december decelerate november wholesale price main contributor reduction decline november deceleration industrial wholesale price december compare november offset high inflation agricultural price year cumulative increase industrial wholesale price stand production stage intermediate good price increase despite recent deceleration industrial component cumulative wholesale price inflation continue represent potential pressure consumer price coming month intensity depend prospective demand condition market inflation expectation assess previous copom minute
ipca core inflation measure continue accelerate december accord three criterion exclude regulate price household food smooth similarly observe headline index acceleration occur third consecutive month cumulative change core inflation exclude regulate price household food headline ipca first time since core addition present underlie inflation trend incompatible inflation target accelerate recent month
industrial output decline november seasonally adjust term line projection previous copom minute however consider revise monthly industrial production data release brazilian institute geography statistic ibge october demonstrate stability instead original drop level series increase compare previous estimate seasonally adjust quarterly move average series show output decline november first time since february decline lead drop intermediate good represent heavy weight industrial production index group directly link final demand grow year november industrial output grow compare period previous year durable capital good continue highlight growth rate consumer good seasonally adjust quarterly move average series post high output level since august sector resume growth behavior confirm change composition economic activity growth increasingly sustain sector
leading coincident indicator industrial activity signal increase output december expectation addition upward revision october figure consistent continuity expansion industrial output observe since second half although necessarily pace observe initial phase give relative accommodation register recent month note prior copom minute normal initial strong impulse growth process converge rate consistent pace output capacity expansion furthermore reasonable expect temporary accommodation monthly sequence high growth rate
labor market continue show sign improvement unemployment rate remain stable november due increase labor force relative total employed population november unemployment rate among best result observe new ibge methodology introduce well rate november accord ministry labor employment formal employment increase creation job december however net hire negative accord ibge number worker payroll increase year november respectively real average wage decline period data national industry confederation cni indicate continued growth industrial employment real wage november
accord ibge retail sale increase november seasonally adjust bcb sale nominal revenue increase respectively twelve month sale furniture appliance vehicle motorcycle continue present strong growth respectively supermarket sale although increase low rate continue support growth margin quarterly moving average basis aggregate sale continue increase although low rate tend toward stability consumer confidence index measure federação comércio estado de são paulo remain high level january positive result employment wage suggest sale dynamism sustain
repeatedly emphasize prior copom minute due significant activity expansion observe since performance aggregate supply come quarter remain important concern prospective inflation dynamic cni instal capacity index decrease modestly november seasonally adjust term third consecutive month domestic absorption capital good increase january november compare period last year despite decrease october cause required registration oil platform produce manage domestically exported product capital good output maintain robust growth rate year third quarter year fix capital investment share gdp remain stable compare cumulative data second quarter recent performance activity level capacity utilization fix capital investment demonstrate significant change scenario discuss prior copom meeting closure output gap despite recovery investment low level recent year therefore monetary policy must remain particularly vigilant regard pace additional demand expansion
external trade surplus increase export increase import expand consequence strong domestic demand among export manufacture sale continue present high volume growth rate january november raw material durable consumer good import register notable volume increase grow respectively period favorable trade surplus support current account surplus u billion equivalent gdp
international capital market environment despite still favorable deteriorate slightly compare december copom meeting brazilian country risk premium decline end last year increase modestly first half january follow release december fomc meeting minute international liquidity market stability remain tied macroeconomic condition industrialized country especially united state possible response fed monetary policy economic development thus new information suggest economic scenario would alter fed current policy gradual interest rate increase result great asset price volatility instability could exacerbate major economy exchange rate undergo sharp adjustment due imbalance country external account
international oil price revert downward trend observe october middle december price volatile due news regard possible supply restriction among export country available oil reserve main consuming country severity northern hemisphere winter recent evolution besides underscore uncertainty regard oil price trend push international gasoline price domestic price leave small room reduction domestic fuel price throughout however copom continue assume change domestic fuel price
since december copom meeting median market expectation collect gerin ipca inflation decline january expectation however increase marginally compare level week end january decline inflation expectation remain modest consider favorable event could contribute dampen inflationary pressure sign deceleration economic growth exchange rate appreciation decline international commodity price signaling restrictive monetary policy
inflation forecast present minimal decline compare release december inflation report benchmark scenario consider maintenance rate exchange rate forecast period exchange rate appreciation increase yield curve modest decline inflation expectation compensate inertial effect tick december inflation nevertheless inflation forecast remains objective forecast base market scenario incorporate consensus exchange rate rate trajectory eve copom meeting exceed benchmark scenario forecast due expected exchange rate depreciation decline interest rate forecast period benchmark scenario forecast target establish national monetary council cmn year market scenario forecast target
since beginning monetary policy adjustment process september deviation copom inflation forecast inflation target trajectory narrow factor however represent risk process inflation convergence target trajectory coming month first possible force stimulate aggregate demand expect forecast exercise uncertainty surround intensity force brazilian economy similar relate immediate monetary policy transmission especially country experience sustained growth last year second stickiness inflation give current aggregate demand condition could also prove intense estimate data available brazilian economy recent acceleration core inflation upward revision industrial output could evidence risk monetary management alternatively could reflect usual transmission lag monetary policy activity inflation
consider likelihood recent consumer price dynamic could actually represent deterioration risk meet inflation target trajectory copom examine possibility accelerate pace interest rate adjustment however consensus among committee member available data would justify acceleration member copom confirm conviction additional phase current process monetary adjustment follow sufficiently long period stable interest rate sufficient align future path inflation monetary policy objective clearly inflationary process prove resistant monetary stance adopt since september risk factor deteriorate monetary authority prepare adjust pace magnitude interest rate adjustment process circumstance
