main impact demand warming observe trade balance deficit register year third week march reach u million despite growth first two month export compare last year import expand high speed period effect economic growth become transparent disaggregated data import increase imported quantum intermediate good capital good last month part increment however reflect growth domestic demand also expansion exported quantity manufactured good net positive effect although lag trade balance increase trade deficit current account deficit contribute affect level exchange rate increase average third quarter last year average year march nonetheless since february evolution exchange rate start reflect deterioration external scenario particular cite great uncertainty pace deceleration u economy reflect part rapid decline stock price trade stock exchange confidence crisis important emerge market like argentina minor degree turkey
external environment
world economy mark deceleration united state stagnation japanese economy whereas european country sustain moderate growth path international scene also influence volatility oil price volatility expect reduce short run give uncertainty world demand possibility new cut opec production addition cut already announce january march
monetary policy u mark three consecutive cut year percentage point fed fund rate u economy go rapid deterioration private confidence increase yet moderate unemployment rate inflation rate remain stable monetary easing may affect positively economy performance second half although magnitude duration current deceleration prove great expect majority analyst week ago

behavior price first two month year influence seasonal factor readjustment enrolment fee tuition well increase raw food product also important increase urban bus fare electricity well water sewage service fee certain state capital ipca accumulate increase first two month compare period year sum accumulate inflation february plus expected increase administered price year reach represent target year
february group transportation education contribute percentage point variation ipca
general price index grow first two month year january february equal period register first month year increase index favor decline price agricultural product revert february grow observe ipa ipc incc register low variation rate compare january case ipa rate reach january february behavior cause basically small increase industrial product price anti ipc deceleration pronounced pass january february incc present rate respectively reduction mainly cause low labor cost
observe supply certain product meet milk contribute less intense degree contention price relation pattern register give occurrence specially favorable meteorological condition year yet consider readjustment already predict contract certain administered price become effective june recent evolution exchange rate reflect deterioration international scene

prospective assessment inflation trend
identified shock impact reassess accordance new information available scenario consider simulation contemplate hypothesis list following
observe inflation february exceed expect value
international spot future oil price recede around u since february therefore spite depreciation take place first quarter estimate decline gasoline price gas station april equivalent estimate decline less refinery small additional reduction july september
average readjustment estimate administered price revise downwards direct impact ipca percentage point revision motivate three factor beyond already mention gasoline price first adoption ibge usual methodology calculation item domestic employee april might reduce variation item readjustment minimum wage something around year effect distribute along year instead fully concentrate april second estimated increase urban bus fare review upwards since city adjustment last year third average readjustment electricity
follow future contract projection hypothesis path fed fund rate include additional reduction basis point third quarter therefore rate would reduce current next stabilizing level
external scenario baseline assume deceleration u economy growth reduction concentrate first half follow recovery starting second half baseline considers recent increase brazil risk premium shall revert year relation last meeting however project small upward shift brazil risk curve
hypothesis consider previous meeting maintain particular realization primary fiscal surplus meet establish fiscal policy target
ipca core inflation calculate method increase january february behavior present ipca core calculate exclusion exclude influence administered price accumulated variation ipca last month increase january february interrupt decline trend initiate september yet core inflation measure release fundação getúlio vargas fell
median expectation ipca variation collect daily survey central bank remain reduce
magnitude recent exchange rate variation give acceleration pace economic activity may increase degree passthrough domestic price case inflationary pressure originate exchange rate channel could elevate inflation rate year simulation exercise scenario consider basic structural model conclusion maintenance interest rate current level represent risk meet inflation target
monetary policy guideline
strong growth economy end continue first month trend nonetheless yet result imbalance supply demand would directly affect inflation index
main impact aggregate demand expansion trade balance although import partially respond increase manufactured export undeniable demand pressure affect import quantum net effect first two month year u million increase trade deficit compare period however prospect second third quarter year improvement foreign trade due beginning shipment agricultural product whole year trade balance essentially depend growth differential brazil main trade partner path real exchange rate
reduction trade balance corresponding increase current account deficit contribute weaken exchange rate despite fact external financing need increase moderately recently exchange rate affect uncertainty external conjuncture particularly relation magnitude downturn united state economy political crisis argentina recent behavior exchange rate therefore result combination temporary well persistent factor
recent currency depreciation raise important issue passthrough exchange rate domestic price since floating uhdo degree passthrough decline steadily give part exchange rate variation perceive permanent transmit price without change significantly inflation expectation however sharp exchange rate depreciation albeit reflect mainly uncertainty market increase degree passthrough extent part depreciation perceive
increase core inflation last month observed inflation expectation uncertainty relate degree passthrough recent exchange rate depreciation give accelerate pace economic activity take together indicate risk achievement target inflation
hence copom decide increase target selic rate per year
close meeting announce committee would meet april pm technical presentation following day pm order discuss monetary policy guideline set calendar copom ordinary meeting publish central bank communiqué
