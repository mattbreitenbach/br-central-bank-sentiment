monetary policy decision
ipca inflation rise april relatively high average post first quarter year spike april due increase tradable good price occur despite slowdown perishable food price inflation regulate price inflation slow modestly remain high level adjustment urban bus fare city increase medicine price among main driver inflationary pressure month also worth note fall month increase ipca diffusion index april
ipca core inflation accelerate april measure monitor copom exclusion trim mean smooth post modest change march core exclusion accelerate april even adjust temporary spike medicine price therefore underlie inflation trend remain inconsistent level inflation target path
inflation decelerate april rise versus march deceleration primarily attributable sharp drop wholesale inflation particularly support drop agricultural price data first ten day may show even large fall agricultural ipa component period likewise industrial ipa inflation increase sharply april decelerate recently emphasize prior copom minute low variation industrial ipa recent month reflect part exchange rate appreciation effect monetary policy could positive spillover future behavior consumer price intensity depend demand condition price setter expectation future inflation path
industrial production rise march seasonally adjust confirm trend suggest lead coincident indicator bring series close record high reach march performance could reflect normalization factor contribute poor result february delay harvest slowdown oil refining well correction inherent fluctuation series due seasonal adjustment move holiday less volatile move average remain stable march elevated level observe since economy continue show sign expansion could expect slow pace register leading coincident indicator suggest continue industrial production growth april
term industrial activity composition strong contribution march stem capital good sector grow two consecutive month contraction contraction consumer durable good production production intermediate good remain stable moving average term consumer durables continue grow capital good remain stable consumer good production show accommodation strong growth recent month finally intermediate good production continue slow possibly reflect negative shock agricultural sector southern brazil affect demand related good mention april copom minute pattern last two month consumer durables production remain strong sector less robust appear inconsistent current phase economic cycle give favorable evolution labor market wage recent month monetary policy stance one would expect growth increasingly sustain sector data necessary well characterize potential change pattern industrial activity
recent labor market data show continuation strong performance recent quarter accord brazilian institute geography statistic ibge survey unemployment rate increase slightly march february line seasonal pattern recent year level number employed worker rise relative february increase real payroll real average earnings manufacture employment measure national industry confederation cni seasonally adjust bcb grow since first quarter real manufacturing payroll fall period grow march formal employment measure ministry labor employment mte also continue expand growth april total new hire high value month since creation series result bring new job creation million last twelve month
retail sale measure ibge rise march seasonally adjust term result could attributable part reversal seasonal effect move holiday furniture household appliance sale post strong performance follow supermarket sale component decline group fuel lubricant moving average term post strong growth may may retail sale moderate among retail sale component supermarket sale post consistently strong growth since furniture household appliance sale show modest accommodation since fabric clothing shoe sale recently decline consumer confidence index fell may remain elevated level
repeatedly emphasize recent copom minute give strong expansion activity since performance aggregate supply come quarter remain key point concern regard prospective inflation dynamic instal capacity utilization measure cni seasonally adjust bcb rise march return record level observe second half capital good absorption rise twelve month end march relative precede twelve month slow pace growth margin reflect comparison significantly high base follow strong investment expansion capital good production accumulate growth last twelve month despite fact recent data negatively affect sharp drop production capital good agricultural sector
strong trade surplus maintain april reinforce expectation strong expect external trade result year export import continue expand fast pace first four month relative period last year twelve month april export grow value term relative accumulate period april comparison base import grow respond strong expansion domestic demand export grow fast pace import trade balance increase u billion last twelve month represent expansion twelve month end april volume term compare first quarter period last year manufacture export continue post strong growth positive performance trade balance contribute current account surplus u billion twelve month end april equivalent gdp therefore external demand continue contribute economic expansion
international capital market remain volatile since april copom meeting appear partially absorb shock downgrade key large corporates united state brazilian country risk show less volatility remain range register period precede april meeting brazilian currency continue appreciate bring exchange rate low level year emphasize prior minute ample international liquidity market stability remain tie macroeconomic condition industrialized country especially united state feed potential monetary policy response economic development copom continue assign low probability significant deterioration international financial market drive abrupt change conduct monetary policy
international oil price continue decline second half april oil price behavior continue reflect information demand condition available oil inventory main consumer country well possible supply restriction among produce country despite reduction observe since april copom meeting international gasoline price remain domestic market projection future path oil price remain surround considerable degree uncertainty concentrate moment doubt persistence current downward trend current oil price behavior increase probability meet copom baseline scenario assume sharp deterioration oil price latent risk central premise committee maintain assumption adjustment domestic fuel price nevertheless important note give significant oscillation international oil price around high level continue represent risk future inflation path although significant last month
since april copom meeting median ipca inflation expectation collect gerin deteriorate emphasize last copom minute expectation inflation minimally effect positive development could dampen inflationary pressure sign deceleration pace economic growth reassessment market expectation exchange rate trajectory restrictive monetary policy stance increase expectation mainly due high expect adjustment regulated price high inflation expectation second quarter less favorable external condition expectation ahead inflation also deteriorate recent week deterioration practically line revision second quarter inflation suggest restrictive monetary policy stance prevent inflationary pressure contaminate long time horizon existence inflation expectation confirm stability inflation expectation second half
inflation forecast benchmark scenario assume maintenance selic rate exchange rate forecast period increase comparison april copom meeting objective year deterioration due surprise april inflation compensate exchange rate appreciation forecast base market scenario incorporate consensus exchange rate selic rate trajectory eve copom meeting benchmark scenario also increase relative april due reason state benchmark scenario change benchmark forecast inflation remain target establish national monetary council next year however slight increase forecast market scenario remain central target
copom also analyze inflation forecast period end march june september result period responsive current monetary policy decision calendar year also reliable calendar year benchmark scenario forecast period end march value interpolate inflation objective target also value project period april copom meeting benchmark scenario forecast twelve month end june september inflation target path period roughly level forecast april meeting
copom reaffirm view effect tighten cycle begin september reflect first quarter inflation result inflation projection economic activity continue expand slow pace line supply condition reduce likelihood significant inflationary pressure addition improvement external scenario gap domestic international price fell nevertheless march april meeting copom identify factor heighten risk inflation convergence target path risk associate persistence isolated pressure current inflation contaminate april inflation contribute deteriorate inflation expectation drive still high core inflation
copom reiterate regime orient toward forecasted future inflation analysis alternative scenario evolution main variable affect price dynamic continuation heightened risk inflation tend increase uncertainty regard future inflation monetary authority assessment inflation dynamic coordination private sector expectation difficult circumstance heighten uncertainty drive increase current headline core inflation reverse response monetary policy could lasting effect inflation expectation therefore monetary policy remain particularly vigilant pressure contaminate inflation expectation stance justified despite monetary policy transmission lag fact monetary adjustment cycle initiate september yet fully incorporate price dynamic
give risk persistence recent month copom decide maintain rate significant period time level establish april meeting would insufficient assure inflation convergence target path consider reason state copom unanimously decide increase selic rate target without bias closely monitor inflation outlook next meeting define next step monetary adjustment process begin september highlight prior minute monetary authority must remain ready adapt pace magnitude interest rate adjustment process prevailing circumstance case exacerbation risk factor monitor committee
