risk around baseline inflation scenario
committee emphasize risk baseline scenario remain direction
one hand economic slack may continue produce prospective inflation trajectory risk increase slow reversion pandemic effect lengthen environment high uncertainty precautionary saving
hand fiscal policy response pandemic permanently aggravate fiscal path frustration regard continuation reform agenda may increase risk premium additionally credit transfer program implement response pandemic may cause decline aggregate demand introduce asymmetry balance risk set factor could potentially result expected path inflation relevant horizon monetary policy
discussion conduct monetary policy
regard global economy data already available promising sign recovery however show incomplete strong recovery consumption follow service sector committee ponder main restriction full recovery major economy evolution pandemic possibility second wave virus major risk
copom member discuss evolution domestic economic activity light available information indicator evaluate recent data suggest partial recovery economic activity government transfer program allow relatively strong resumption durable good consumption even investment however several service sector activity especially directly affect social distancing measure remain quite depress look forward poor predictability associate evolution pandemic necessary decline emergency aid end increase uncertainty speed economic recovery committee consider unpredictability risk associate evolution pandemic may imply domestic scenario characterize even gradual recovery economy
copom member debate level economic slack activity committee believe pandemic continue heterogeneous effect economic sector give nature shock service sector continue large economic slack sector committee conclude nature crisis probably imply disinflationary pressure reduce demand may last long previous recession
committee assess appropriate degree stimulus current environment first analyze whether existence asymmetry balance risk mainly relate fiscal issue continuation reform brazilian economy would sufficient reason maintain stimulus current level give perception economic slack prospective inflation committee consider although asymmetric projection inflation target relevant horizon monetary policy therefore line inflation target mandate committee conclude would appropriate increase residually degree monetary stimulus
committee resume discussion potential effective low limit brazilian policy interest rate connection prudential financial stability issue majority member copom limit would significantly high among emerge economy among developed country due existence risk premium premium dynamic tend large brazil give country relative fiscal fragility uncertainty regard prospective fiscal path context would already close level interest rate reduction could accompany asset price instability
copom also discuss relative importance main component credit operating cost financial system consider long history brazilian economy operate basic interest rate high level unprecedented low interest rate may compromise performance market economic sector potential impact financial intermediation base result stress test scenario committee considers financial system resilient credit risk arise current pandemic however analyze financial system broad way consider various industry market product financial service committee reflect unprecedentedly low interest rate environment may generate increased asset price volatility moreover without necessary time transition new environment may affect proper functioning dynamic financial system capital market hence committee conclude possible new interest rate reduction would demand caution additional gradualism end necessary interest rate cut would require great clarity prospective inflation activity could space time
order provide monetary stimulus deem adequate meet inflation target maintain necessary caution prudential reason copom consider use forward guidance additional monetary policy tool copom discuss limitation use instrument emerge country relative develop country emerge country susceptible contagion external crisis great vulnerability economic fundamental therefore due great unpredictability volatility use instrument become challenging committee conclude despite limitation forward guidance would policy strategy best ratio forward guidance transmit committee vision future action tend adjust expectation reflect intermediary part yield curve
adapt forward guidance dynamic limit impose prudential issue committee consider asymmetric policy intention necessary condition meet copom would raise interest rate could reduce maximize effectiveness committee decide forward guidance conditional inflation expectation well inflation projection baseline scenario relevant monetary policy horizon currently include less extent information inflation would consider altogether sufficiently close inflation target corresponding horizon would indicate end intention
give difficulty inherent use forward guidance emerge economy addition expectation projection inflation relevant horizon committee also deem necessary condition interest rate policy intention two factor first conditional maintenance fiscal regime since rupture would imply significant change structural interest rate economy second conditional anchoring inflation expectation give unanchoring would indicate cost derive monetary stimulus would outweigh benefit
monetary policy decision
take account baseline scenario balance risk broad array available information copom unanimously decide lower selic rate percentage point committee judge decision reflect baseline scenario prospective inflation variance balance risk consistent convergence inflation target relevant horizon monetary policy include less extent
committee believe persevere process reform necessary adjustment brazilian economy essential sustainable economic recovery copom also stress doubt regard continuation reform agenda permanent change fiscal consolidation process could result increase structural interest rate
copom believe current economic condition continue recommend unusually strong monetary stimulus recognize due prudential financial stability reason remain space monetary policy stimulus exist small consequently possible future adjustment current degree monetary stimulus would occur additional gradualism would depend perception fiscal trajectory well new information change committee current assessment prospective inflation
despite asymmetry balance risk copom foresee reduction monetary stimulus unless inflation expectation well baseline scenario inflation projection sufficiently close inflation target relevant horizon monetary policy currently include less extent intention conditional maintenance current fiscal regime anchoring inflation expectation
