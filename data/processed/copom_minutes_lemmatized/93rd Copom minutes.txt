concern são paulo consumer price index inflation diminish first week february january however decrease necessarily representative ipca trend index encompass different geographical area different basket good different methodology index also present different behavior recent past last twelve month post change low ipca change period gap change price são paulo area brazil also detect ipca regional breakdown last twelve month accumulated change são paulo ipca rise average change city survey rise
important individual contribution ipca result january electricity tariff car price fresh food product rice bean bottle gas altogether account total change index market price change month contribute overall result ipca increase regulated price contribute among latter high contribution come electricity bottle gas gasoline base auto fuel health insurance plan
concern wholesale price remain roughly stable january behavior result reduction agricultural price increase industrial price agricultural ipa register variation january rise december mainly reflect fall price meat chicken milk egg product compensate price increase fresh food item coffee bean industrial ipa post change compare december third consecutive acceleration high contribution industrial ipa acceleration come metallurgy industry iron metal steel chemical industry plastic fertilizer others transportation industry fabric clothing shoe monthly change remain stable albeit high level third consecutive month still reflect effect cotton price increase
core ipca inflation calculate exclude household food item regulate price post increase january remain relatively stable comparison variation december transportation personal expense contribute intensely result consider accumulated change twelve month core register variation january compare variation december

effect food price recent slowdown reflect beginning harvest period fall fresh food price likely moderate remain pressure inflation february trend already noticeable partial result already disclose february wholesale inflation industrial price continue reflect cost increase regard ipca favorable evolution food price offset price increase education health insurance plan telephone tariff
assessment inflation trend
identified shock impact reassess accord newly available information scenario consider simulation assume following hypothesis gasoline bottle cooking gas price projection maintain respectively household electricity tariff expect increase reduction compare expectation last copom meeting projection telephone tariff slightly rise reach regard regulate price total weight january ipca copom maintain projection nearly unchanged projection readjustment regulated price base endogenous determination model increase model take account seasonal factor exchange rate behavior market price change igp inflation rate projection trajectory spread selic rate follow specification vector autoregressive model use selic swap rate eve copom meeting reach fourth quarter
regard fiscal policy assume primary surplus target gdp following two year achieve related assumption consider previous meeting maintain

monetary policy decision
inflation rate accelerate december january ipca variation january significantly high market consensus eve december copom meeting inflation three group ipca tradable regulated item stood high increase january tradable good january result remain similar one observe december around regulated price change depart already high level december increase january post respectively third consecutive rise series
accelerate january december inflation measure general price index also rise january inflation measure remain practically stable december january high rate spite strongly favor agricultural ipa fall industrial ipa rise third month row reach january high figure since march
core inflation measure remain practically stable january level inconsistent inflation target core ipca calculate exclude household food item regulate price post january close variation observe december high november core ipca calculate smoothed method present similar behavior november december january core calculate symmetric method rise january december ratio item positive variation ipca increase january december high level since april
economic activity indicator remain consistent economic recovery scenario copom work last month significant fall first half industrial production present strong growth second half year industrial production quarterly move average accumulate growth june december seasonally adjust period durable good capital good output production present growth respectively
period semi good output strongly influence real earnings register drop quarterly move average copom stress remark make january meeting minute sector recovery come naturally consequence gradual dissemination growth throughout economy excessive monetary ease objective push specific sector forward would intensify short run recovery gap amongst sector would allow inflationary pressure arise lead sector
december industrial output present fall seasonally adjust relation previous month quarterly moving average take output decrease december diminishes close december historical peak volatility around underlie output trend normal period economic recovery volatility indicate economic rebound process lose steam especially monetary easing take place second half yet fully materialize
industrial sale growth surpass industrial production growth third consecutive month second half industrial sale increase industrial output gap augment fourth quarter industrial sale increase output different growth rate suggest high expansionary stimulus industrial output term come inventory dynamic well improved consumer confidence real earnings growth credit expansion
accord ibge data seasonally adjust bcb retail sale quarterly move average grow december compare november june december industrial sale retail sale growth lead sector directly favor credit expansion furniture appliance june december automobile motorcycle period likely scenario continuous recovery consumption consequence improved consumer sentiment high real payroll low consumer default rate
previous month external sector continue post positive performance january export import increase respectively compare january trade balance current account register u billion u billion surplus respectively increase sovereign risk perception due market concern rise u interest rate impact emerge market liquidity consequence brazil increase nearly january february copom meeting period private external funding diminish dollar appreciate nonetheless external scenario remain positive favorable perspective global growth increase demand brazilian export adequate liquidity condition
first quarter market inflation expectation increase since december inflation january high market consensus preliminary data suggest february inflation also high previous forecast consider eve copom meeting median first quarter inflation expectation five accurate forecaster top forecaster increase february january december median market inflation expectation rise february december despite high expectation first quarter inflation median inflation remain stable respectively
bcb inflation forecast accord benchmark scenario assume unchanged selic rate exchange rate target target compare january increase inflation projection due inflation january due impact exchange rate depreciation forecast remain unaltered market scenario take account path exchange rate rate expect market participant eve copom meeting bcb inflation estimate target
copom also examine inflation projection produce accord methodology accord benchmark market scenario take account top term inflation expectation february march hence project inflation following month exercise project inflation slightly target even benchmark scenario although projection remains target procedure consider market scenario show increase difference project inflation rate target
consider plan period january inflation high first quarter year justified expect seasonal behavior persists february inflation show reversion relation january however since january meeting copom yet identify factor could reduce risk inflation high target first ipca different core measure january well expectation february point reduction trend preliminary evidence inflation deceleration find partial result weekly however inflation persists high level reduction intense yet due reason describe paragraph pattern may ipca second inflation measure industrial ipa remain high accelerate influence increase commodity price high demand input relative price realignment favor sector benefit strong demand although high wholesale inflation necessarily transmit consumer intensity high passthrough would happen consequence perception lenient monetary policy scenario produce recovery certain sector
even consider recent inflation increase cause seasonal factor consider return inflation path consistent inflation target near future achievement target require cautious monetary policy result high inflation january high inflation expectation
consequently consider uncertainty magnitude lag output gap inflation reduction rate take place june december copom maintain january minute diagnosis real likelihood inflation deviate target require extra concern monetary policymaking
balance risk inflation deviate target interruption economy recovery process change significantly since january resume monetary ease prematurely significantly increase risk actual inflation deviate target could force change monetary stance medium run strong interest rate movement significant effect economic activity hand unchanged selic rate cause substantial low risk damage process economy recovery
result committee decide unanimously maintain target rate without bias look forward consistent signal low risk inflation deviate target path
closing meeting announce copom would meet march technical presentation following day order discuss monetary policy decision establish communiqué october summary data analyze copom
