trade balance continue present robust performance confirm evaluation base upon inflation report previous copom minute depict important structural change brazilian foreign trade reach u billion record high increase result trade balance continuous register vigorous surplus encourage analyst review positively forecast year may trade surplus reach u billion increase relative may export rise u billion import increase u billion observe previous copom minute import grow rapidly export margin due high level economic activity also strengthening brl point healthy adjustment process trade balance
regard international scenario uncertainty surround monetary policy stance u persist signal inflation could run fomc comfort zone indicate expectancy easing cycle start year may premature moreover additional interest rate increase u discard similarly possibility economic deceleration potential effect worldwide economy ignore hand strengthening economic activity europe continuity robust expansion major country asia far compensate moderate economic deceleration u maintenance growth rate historically high level cause high inflationary pressure especially raw material food price context robust global growth economy price brazilian asset show remarkable resilience fluctuation international financial market thanks improvement economic fundamental recent year benign behavior export price sense addition show resilience change international market sentiment brazilian economy trail growth cycle price stability consider factor copom continue consider international scenario favorable
oil price another external source uncertainty rise since last copom meeting still present volatility recent level international price commodity seem reflect structural shift global demand energy recurrent episode geopolitical tension despite significant risk inherent forecast future oil price trajectory main scenario consider copom attribute change domestic gasoline price continue plausible
assessment inflation trend
identified shock impact reassess accord newly available information scenario consider simulation utilize following assumption compare value consider april copom meeting projection gasoline bottle gas price adjustment maintain projection electricity fix telephone price adjustment modify relative april forecast new projection electricity fix telephone respectively projection regulated price inflation decrease projection april copom meeting item accord weight release ibge represent total may ipca projection regulated price inflation also change projection base endogenous determination model regulated price model consider effect seasonal component exchange rate change market price inflation igp projection spread selic rate use vector autoregressive model base selic swap rate eve meeting estimate bps fourth quarter reach bps last quarter

monetary policy decision
copom reaffirm view express previous minute addition contain inflationary pressure monetary policy also contribute significantly consolidation favorable term macroeconomic environment economic activity data point strengthen demand expansion still suggest high probability important pressure inflation import expansion contribute significantly process complement domestic production therefore limit potential inflationary effect aggregate demand sustain growth moreover despite uncertainty regard continuity strong growth recently observe international economy prospect low liquidity important international market volatility increase global market external outlook remain favorable particularly regard brazilian external financing combination significant trade surplus increase capital inflow suggest balance payment continue perform robustly therefore prospect inflation trajectory remain benign recent meeting copom emphasize main challenge monetary policy context guarantee consolidation positive development anticipate future
copom evaluate benign behavior inflation recent month contrast relatively high monthly rate persist since end confirm convergence inflation trajectory target path emergency global inflationary pressure still present risk domestic inflation trajectory short run heated demand could increase wholesale price pressure consumer price sense copom continue manage monetary policy stance gain obtain inflation control recent year become permanent respect copom carefully monitor evolution inflation several core inflation measure upcoming month discriminate persistent generalized price increase promptly adjust monetary policy stance circumstance
preservation inflation rate line target path consolidation stable macroeconomic scenario contribute progressive reduction macroeconomic risk perception underway scope reduction real interest rate future naturally follow consequence improved perception copom evaluate cautious monetary policy stance critical increase probability inflation convergence target path materialize however important look inflation indicator remain consistent recent benign inflation outlook observe last quarter
copom emphasize important time lag transmission monetary policy stance economic activity inflation since beginning monetary easing cycle september selic rate already reduce bulk reduction concentrate last nine month consequently activity level completely mirror effect interest rate cut well effect economic activity resumption inflation completely materialize therefore evaluation alternative monetary policy stance necessarily focus prospective inflation scenario risk instead current inflation indicator
coming month employment income expansion credit growth continue bolster economic activity mention recent copom minute activity level also reflect effect governmental transfer fiscal impulse occur expect next quarter year consequently lagged effect interest rate cut increasingly robust aggregate demand add factor continue contribute expansion issue become even relevant consider sign heated aggregate demand fact monetary policy decision limit effect predominant impact
light exist incentive expand aggregate demand uncertainty surround monetary policy transmission mechanism low distance current selic rate equilibrium interest rate interest rate cut implement since september copom member understand preservation important achievement disinflation preserve economic growth job creation rise real income demand cautious monetary ease stance
copom evaluate since last meeting influence internal external factor balance risk expected inflation trajectory exacerbate opposite direction external sector act importantly widen aggregate supply continue influence inflation prospect predominantly benign way hand expansion domestic demand may increase risk inflation dynamic
participant committee understood consider extension ease process already implement remain uncertainty regard lagged impact monetary easing expected behavior sustain factor expenditure income growth scenario solid expansion domestic demand tradable good service economic activity strengthening maintenance reduction pace selic target rate would contribute extend easing process time
however majority committee argue contribution external sector consolidation benign outlook inflation could high previously expect especially control price tradable good increase investment heated demand environment contribution favor equilibrium aggregate demand domestic supply growth rate pace line monetary policy decision without compromise convergence inflation target trajectory therefore five member committee understood risk balance evolution future inflation would justify reduction selic target rate
give reason state copom decide continue monetary easing cycle reduce selic target rate without bias five vote copom monetary policy action two vote favor reduce selic target basis point
regime monetary authority decide accord inflation prospect analyze alternative scenario main variable determine price dynamic balance risk associate forecast despite remain uncertainty regard u economy international scenario remain favorable benefit external sector contribution maintenance benign inflationary outlook hand set price pressure arise domestic demand expand vigorously economic activity recovery expansion encompass sector little expose external competition effect important incentive factor monetary easing already implement fully perceive environment monetary authority must remain vigilant uncertainty contaminate long time horizon
