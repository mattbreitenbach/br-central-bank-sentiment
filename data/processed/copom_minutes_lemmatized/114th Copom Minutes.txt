monetary policy decision
copom reaffirm view express prior minute actual expect inflation result demonstrate monetary tightening cycle begin september contain inflationary pressure consolidate favorable macroeconomic environment economic activity recover coming month continue expand pace consistent supply condition introduce significant inflationary pressure addition despite continue volatility international financial market persistence high oil price external environment remain favorable particularly regard external financing condition country therefore benign inflation environment continue evolve october meeting committee emphasize main challenge monetary policy ensure consolidation favorable development
copom considers increase inflation drive largely domestic fuel price adjustment implement well partial reversal favorable food price dynamic observe recent month envisage recent copom minute effect factor fully reflect therefore likely affect inflation measure release coming week since transitory pressure expect ease time without necessarily contaminate long time horizon nevertheless uptick inflation broadly expect magnitude significantly exceed expectation prevail time september copom meeting committee continue closely monitor evolution core headline inflation coming month distinguish generalized persistent price adjustment adapt monetary stance circumstance order ensure gain achieve thus far reduce inflation make permanent
uninterrupted convergence inflation target path result consolidation lasting macroeconomic stability contribute progressive reduction perceived macroeconomic risk process already underway several year brazil scope reduction real interest rate future naturally follow copom consider cautious monetary policy stance critical increase probability inflation convergence target path materialize however important inflation indicator remain compatible recent benign inflation outlook way gradual easing monetary stance compromise important achievement make lower inflation preserve economic growth job creation rise real income
copom therefore unanimously decide continue monetary easing process begin september meeting reduce selic target rate without bias
