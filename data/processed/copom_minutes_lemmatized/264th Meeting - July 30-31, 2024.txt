committee closely monitor recent development fiscal side impact monetary policy financial asset moreover note recent market agent perception public spending growth sustainability current fiscal framework couple factor significant impact asset price expectation committee stress credible fiscal policy commit debt sustainability contribute anchoring inflation expectation reduction risk premia financial asset therefore impact monetary policy synchronous countercyclical monetary fiscal policy help ensure price stability without prejudice fundamental objective smooth fluctuation economic activity level foster full employment
committee unanimously believe reanchoring inflation expectation see essential element ensure inflation convergence target pursue committee believe conduct monetary policy key factor reanchoring expectation continue make decision safeguard credibility consequently reduce cost disinflation committee shy away commitment reach inflation target understand fundamental role expectation inflation dynamic
recent movement conditioning factor inflation dynamic inflation expectation exchange rate thoroughly discuss note movement persistent result inflationary impact may significant duly incorporate committee result committee consider time diligent monitoring determinant inflation great vigilance face challenging scenario
credit cycle remain benign volume expansion rate reduction credit line however member emphasize recent increase rate could result low credit market dynamic turn capital market funding remain strong member highlight importance long vertex yield curve determination credit supply demand
committee assess inflation data suggest path diverge significantly expect disinflationary process slow recent period industrial good inflation rate maintain recent trajectory longer contribute disinflation stage disinflationary process time service inflation great inertia play major role disinflationary dynamic current stage copom member discuss role labor market dynamic inflation expectation determine service inflation copom conclude disinflationary process slow current inflation level target context dynamic economic activity make inflation convergence target challenging
copom conclude inflation outlook become challenging increase inflation projection even condition high interest rate path unanimous conclusion need even cautious monetary policy diligent monitoring unfolding scenario
committee emphasize risk scenario remain direction among upside risk inflationary scenario inflation expectation emphasize prolonged period deanchoring inflation expectation ii resilience service inflation due tighter output gap iii conjunction internal external economic policy inflationary impact example persistently depreciated currency among downside risk note deceleration global economic activity ii impact global inflation large expect monetary policy tightening discussion member agree upside risk inflation several member even emphasize asymmetry balance risk
committee judge domestic international environment require even great caution conduct monetary policy particular inflationary impact movement market variable inflation expectation persistent corroborate need vigilance
discussion conduct monetary policy
copom discuss conduct monetary policy consider set projection evaluate well balance risk prospective inflation
committee unanimously decide maintain selic rate regard domestic economy labor market economic activity particular household consumption surprising diverge expect slowdown scenario furthermore inflation projection relevant monetary policy horizon increase despite new rise selic rate path extract focus survey similarly inflation expectation show deanchoring since previous meeting moreover external environment remain adverse uncertainty effect extension ease cycle united state
thus committee consider monetary policy continue contractionary sufficient time level consolidate disinflation process anchoring expectation around target
scenario mark high projection upside inflation risk challenge committee believe unfolding scenario particularly important define next monetary policy step therefore committee unanimously believe current stage even great caution diligent monitoring inflation condition factor without commit future strategy light monitoring committee assess best strategy one hand whether strategy maintain interest rate sufficiently long time bring inflation target relevant horizon hand copom unanimously reinforce hesitate raise interest rate ensure inflation convergence target deem appropriate usual strategy adopt committee reflect commitment reach inflation target also aim reanchor inflation expectation minimize cost disinflation committee remain vigilant remind potential future change interest rate determine firm commitment reach inflation target
monetary policy decision
consider evolution disinflationary process assessed scenario balance risk broad array available information copom decide maintain selic rate judge decision consistent strategy inflation convergence level around target throughout relevant horizon monetary policy without compromise fundamental objective ensure price stability decision also imply smooth economic fluctuation foster full employment
current context characterize stage disinflationary process tend slow deanchoring inflation expectation challenging global outlook require serenity moderation conduct monetary policy
committee unanimously decide keep interest rate unchanged highlight uncertain global scenario domestic scenario mark resilient economic activity increase inflation projection deanchored expectation require diligent monitoring even great caution committee also stress monetary policy continue contractionary sufficient time level consolidate disinflation process anchoring expectation around target committee remain vigilant remind potential future change interest rate determine firm commitment reach inflation target
