monetary policy decision
deceleration ipca september august mainly result behavior fresh food price fell september increase august exclude food deceleration market price inflation period would significantly less intense volatile price shock fresh food impact current inflation rate however cause limited effect future inflation trajectory
wholesale inflation also fell favor food price however industrial wholesale inflation remain high level september year compare current dynamic industrial price wholesale retail segment potential wholesale retail price noticeable cause important source pressure consumer inflation incoming month intensity depend future inflation expectation
ipca core exclude household food regulate price core smoothed trim mean also decelerate september hand core smooth trim mean aim incorporate regulated price underlie trend ipca stood practically stable annual rate close important note core measure calculate order eliminate part volatility headline index completely marginal variation interpret change inflation trend behavior ipca core last month still indicate underlying inflation trend incompatible target path
accord brazilian institute geography statistic ibge industrial output grow august seasonally adjust term impressive figure significantly high market consensus eve publication data market expectation fact negatively influence fall package paper shipment august fall follow sharp increase july fully reflect industrial output performance mention september copom minute monthly packaging paper shipment imprecise coincident indicator industrial activity analyze apart historical series september lead coincident indicator anticipate slight decrease seasonally adjust monthly industrial performance volatility industrial output neither allow interpretation surprisingly positive monthly figure definitive evidence acceleration growth trend mean marginal accommodation clear sign expansion lose momentum fact august sixth consecutive month growth seasonally adjust industrial output series long monotonic growth observe since presence cyclical fluctuation around underlying trend common behavior even period strong activity expansion
unemployment rate remain practically stable july august significant low level one observe august number employed worker increase august sustain upward trend initiate beginning year accord ministry labor employment formal employment grow august year represent addition worker formal labor market first month accord federation industry state são paulo fiesp national industry confederation cni survey real wage continue increase progressive recovery employment labor income perform increasingly important role sustainability current economic recovery process also contribute balanced expansion among several economic activity

external sector sustain dynamism export expand year september compare period comparison basis import grow respond strongly rebound domestic demand period september trade balance total u billion result current account surplus u billion approximately gdp
international crude oil price resume upward trend since september copom meeting current price increase also perspective price remain high level long period strengthen risk enhance likelihood face sustained increase oil price reduction current unusual lag international gasoline price domestic scenario still indefinite realignment oil price international price increase probability realignment consider postpone avoid could contaminate great intensity inflation rate besides mere postponement would reduce monetary policy effectiveness expand time horizon private agent expect imminent inflationary shock uncertain magnitude require high nominal interest rate order produce expect real interest rate
benchmark scenario copom maintain unchanged projection domestic gasoline price copom assume projection generate endogenous determination model regulated price committee carefully ponder international oil price face adverse environment current one still regard potential risk though increasingly high materialization benchmark scenario copom soon produce disaggregate projection gasoline price well regulated price reassess extent adverse circumstance oil market incorporate assumption benchmark scenario
international capital market start express great concern growth dynamic main economy uncertainty trigger hike oil price result great market volatility immediate effect brazilian foreign exchange market favorable scenario enable real appreciation since last june could harm case large deterioration oil price uncertain impact world economy growth
since last copom meeting median market expectation ipca drop reduction result september inflation rate cause transitory factor already discuss hand market expectation ipca increase deterioration inflation expectation stop yet despite current favorable trend inflation exchange rate appreciation recent fall important commodity price signaling monetary tightening last month
copom emphasize monetary policy adjustment base inflation scenario conduct inflation expectation private agent however private sector expectation important impact monetary policy effectiveness affect expected real interest rate correspond certain nominal yield curve give demand condition significantly influence decision relevance inflation expectation monitor copom monetary authority worldwide whichever degree accuracy
copom projection ipca fell mainly due favorable september result benchmark market scenario copom projection ipca stand target establish year likelihood surpass upper limit tolerance interval diminish projection scenario stand close value present september issue inflation report benchmark scenario assume maintenance rate exchange rate throughout projection horizon real appreciation almost counterbalance deterioration inflation expectation maintain project ipca objective describe september minute projection base market scenario incorporate exchange rate rate expect market eve copom meeting stand projection benchmark scenario
copom reiterate consider natural economic growth pace spontaneously slow initial monetary impulse lose momentum economy become sustain auto propagation mechanism link income increase although spontaneous slowdown may course available data suggest intense enough preserve compatibility inflation target productive capacity despite difficulty measure installed capacity industry aggregate term potential output undeniable idle capacity quickly lessen last month consider production level recently achieve monetary stance carefully accommodate marginal expansion demand
monetary policy adjustment initiate september aim promote convergence inflation rate target path incorporate objective adjust output gap inflation target path monetary policy avoid deep damage growth cycle would take place drastic measure necessary disinflate economy prevent inflation increase also essential perverse labor income thus maintain sound balanced recovery process main objective adjustment monetary policy therefore ensure sustainable growth condition
consequence copom understand current circumstance recommend continuity process initiate september moderate adjustment rate although increase consider adequate begin adjustment smooth inflexion monetary stance minimize initial turbulence risk committee evaluate moment rise adequate magnitude speed require promote convergence inflation rate target path
consider reason state copom decide unanimously increase selic rate target without bias
even though copom assume monetary adjustment carry magnitude pace originally set current scenario hold two potential new risk first increase oil price term magnitude term extent second marginal deterioration market inflation expectation even adjustment monetary stance alert possible downward rigidity
closing meeting announce copom would meet november technical presentation following day discuss monetary policy decision establish communiqué october summary data analyze copom
