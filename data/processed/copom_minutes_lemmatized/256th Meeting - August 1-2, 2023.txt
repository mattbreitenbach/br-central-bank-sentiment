committee evaluate international outlook uncertain committee note resilience activity labor market advanced economy even moderation observe margin well low growth projection chinese economy context member see mild moderation activity major economy likely although sharp slowdown rule disinflation process margin observe reflect slowdown commodity pressure initial impact war ukraine normalization productive sector slow decline core inflation look ahead uncertainty remain global inflation dynamic downward movement commodity price stall recent period risk relate weather phenomenon war ukraine international oil pricing policy suggest possibility renew inflationary pressure furthermore observed resilience labor market tight output gap advanced economy environment still pressure service inflation several economy thus central bank remain committed control inflation maintain tight monetary policy long period determination albeit likely impact upon domestic asset price short term couple credit slowdown major economy contributes credible lasting global disinflationary process moreover committee consider synchronization contractionary monetary policy may impact global output gap disinflation process upward impact inflation synchronization expansionary fiscal monetary policy across country pandemic mention
growth data brazil remain consistent reference scenario moderate activity anticipate committee process rebalancing consumption basket consequently relative price good service continue moderation consumption good favor great demand service segment however service sector moderate recent month addition timely data continue suggest pace economic growth line committee expectation discussion development labor market take place member still consider recent moderation labor market point slowdown pace hirings formal market decline participation rate member emphasize drop unemployment rate still high pace hirings formal employment committee agree evidence high wage pressure labor negotiation member note recent process towards partial recomposition previous loss real wage move forward movement expect accompany deceleration nominal gain expect intensify ahead
committee analyze different output gap metric assumption compare estimate current gap level different method also impact inflation projection note speed gap assume close projection horizon important initial level assume gap discuss risk output gap tight assume reference scenario particular labor market assess impact alternative assumption inflation projection committee emphasize output gap unobservable variable subject uncertainty measurement even great uncertainty pandemic period
committee believe disinflation dynamic continue characterize process two distinct stage movement prove deep expect give benign dynamic food industrial price behavior wholesale price regard recent dynamic exchange rate international commodity price although great volatility contribute slow international pressure inflation brazil one hand phenomenon improve dynamic second stage disinflation low inertia core inflation service inflation hand inherent volatility food industrial good component suggest possibility abrupt reversal recommend caution debate risk relate el niño partially incorporate reference scenario mention relate international oil price development follow committee usual governance assumption end unanimously conclude contractionary cautious monetary policy need reinforce disinflationary dynamic
also discussion inflationary behavior current stage disinflationary process recent behavior service inflation discuss depth note indicator segment point continuity trajectory disinflation recent period despite oscillation level still value compatible target discussion emphasize relevant focus underlying fundamental particular possible change labor market dynamic activity punctual movement service inflation relative component period
inflation expectation show partial reanchoring since previous copom meeting committee emphasize credibility gain produce june meeting national monetary council cmn establish inflation target well tolerance range value without revise target range previously establish
addition announcement change continuous target system rule yet set reduce uncertainty target subsequent year also contribute reanchoring therefore positive impact inflation expectation immediately cmn decision reinforce interpretation inflation target regime gain credibility
however reanchoring still partial committee discuss reason deanchoring member raise several possibility committee remove residual uncertainty approval fiscal framework balance risk note discussion fiscal dynamic remain relevant reference scenario particular member assess uncertainty persist among agent overcome fiscal challenge evidence primary balance expectation diverge target set government may also reflect unanchored inflation expectation long maturity case anchor expectation around target set new fiscal framework maintenance fiscal commitment addition reduction uncertainty tax measure underpin implementation objective would contribute fast disinflationary process others evaluate global scenario high inflation also make difficult reanchor expectation since possibility external inflation high level long period finally hypothesis agent perception time banco central brasil bcb would become lenient fight inflation mention copom member unanimously understand regardless bcb board composition institution credibility reputation ensure
copom reminds structural reform predictability public account essential increase economy productivity raise potential growth improve confidence business investor household lack commitment structural reform increase earmarked credit granting uncertainty stabilization public debt potential raise neutral interest rate economy harmful impact monetary policy power consequently cost economy
committee emphasize risk scenario remain direction among upside risk inflationary scenario inflation expectation emphasize great persistence global inflationary pressure ii strong expect resiliency service inflation due tighter output gap among downside risk note great project deceleration global economic activity particularly due adverse condition global financial system ii impact global disinflation large expect synchronized monetary policy tightening
discussion conduct monetary policy

committee unanimously evaluate evolution scenario since previous meeting give necessary confidence start gradual cycle monetary easing evaluation involve different dimension firstly emphasize positive behavior inflation expectation follow setting target cmn announcement change continuous target system reduction inflation expectation well inflation rate reduce cost disinflation impact real interest rate economy previously alert copom secondly headline inflation measure register clear improvement service inflation continue decelerate margin member emphasize recent dynamic others emphasize underlying fundamental dynamic service inflation allow yet convincingly extrapolate recent benign behavior regard output gap member note upward revision estimate committee discuss implication alternative output gap measure model respective impact projection finally observe partial reanchoring expectation contribute reduce projection reference scenario however movement counterbalance update variable reference scenario affect estimate projection output gap inflation projection differ significantly previous meeting scenario evaluation member agree appropriate reduce selic rate meeting
