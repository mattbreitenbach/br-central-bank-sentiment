monetary policy decision
copom reaffirm view express previous minute addition contain inflationary pressure monetary policy also contribute significantly consolidation favorable term macroeconomic environment economic activity data still suggest high probability important pressure inflation import expansion contribute significantly process complement domestic production therefore limit potential inflationary effect aggregated demand sustain growth moreover despite prospect low liquidity international market due interest rate increase industrialized economy volatility increase global market external outlook remain favorable particularly regard brazilian external financing copom continue assign low probability significant deterioration international financial market condition therefore prospect inflation trajectory remain benign recent meeting copom emphasize main challenge monetary policy context guarantee consolidation positive development anticipate future
copom evaluate relatively high inflation monthly rate persist since end represent yet risk inflation trajectory part inflation increase start year due factor elevation food price seasonal component tuition fee readjustment addition certain pressure service price due nature pressure expect dampen throughout time without necessarily affect horizon however copom continue manage monetary policy stance gain obtain inflation control recent year become permanent respect copom carefully monitor evolution inflation several core inflation measure upcoming month discriminate persistent generalized price increase promptly adjust monetary policy stance circumstance
