assessment inflation trend
identified shock inflationary impact reassess accord newly available information scenario consider simulation assume following hypothesis
projection increase gasoline price revise include rise beginning year increase forecast price bottled gas compare
january copom meeting
regard previous meeting forecasted rise household electricity tariff decrease due revision readjustment propose aneel year
set regulated monitor price weight january ipca crease project already occur january decrease projection household electricity tariff offset high price gasoline bottle gas urban transport interstate transport forecast increase set regulated monitored price increase compare january estimate due revision pectations since copom assume regulate monitor price follow change specified year
projection spread selic rate utilize error model specification first quarter though gradually reach end
core inflation calculate exclusion household food item regulated monitor price post increase january significant decrease comparison observe december still high observe previous month january accumulated change core inflation calculate method register increase january back value register november slightly december figure last month core crease regard core inflation calculate symmetric method inflation rate reach december month
accumulated variation ipca month increase january compare december last month free market price contribute inflation price regulate monitor contribute

monetary policy guideline
last year confidence crisis regard future brazilian economy increase global risk aversion result billion decrease capital inflow brazil current account deficit adjustment nearly gdp external adjustment trigger sharp exchange rate depreciation since gdp grow around significant exchange rate depreciation represent important shift relative price result inflation rate last quarter high inflation major cost inherit last year crisis
brazilian economy react last year shock measure recover dence allow capital flow return fx inflow positive january u billion first time since march trend sustain february regard primary placement public security ury issue large volume lft pressure yield tenure turn inflation sumer decelerate ipca move peak november january similarly free market price inflation decrease since peak november december january
reason believe inflation may continue decrease one hand economic activity seem decelerate retail sector sharpened decrease real sale december reflect fall real income worsen credit condition consumer industrial production month interrupt ing trajectory drawn previous six month base lead indicator may continue move backwards january sense important consider future impact inflation accumulated increase rate since last october hand maintenance pace capital inflow observe beginning year may imply high supply fx market less adverse external scenario allow favorable pressure exchange rate
notwithstanding risk inflation continue high level current inflation level show rigidity due inertial mechanism price formation brazilian economy high inflation last year reflect high inflation beginning year ipca core inflation january move ward compare previous month variation high observe three first quarter estimate consumer price index february continue show high rate inflation high january second estimate february increase slightly first week well second preview january
preliminary data price collect last week indicate free market price inflation decrease february even though strong pressure item natura food school fee however result price collection suggest high variation ipca compare adjust inflation target jectory
last year trend regulate monitor price continue put strong pressure consumer tion january ipca inflation move upward due significant increase regulated monitor price time high free price average increase even weight regulate monitor price responsible january ipca rate ipca accumulate last month
example free market price inflation reach january price gasoline consumer rise major individual contribution ipca month increase due passthrough rise refinery last december besides increase cause change basis culating icms fuel price increase january compare previous month mainly rise endorse producer price diesel oil increase january add increase december price increase january reflect mainly readjustment erie december
readjustment urban transport fare also put strong pressure regulated price january even strong increase december local government belo horizonte são paulo salvador porto alegre fortaleza practice significant increase interstate bus fare also readjust pressure come increase belo horizonte são paulo belém porto alegre salvador
moreover increase household electricity tariff due readjustment rio de janeiro brasília rio one concessionaries carry contractual readjustment
highlight effect readjustment regulated monitor price may tribute directly inflation also risk propagate secondarily free market price
important say three first quarter accumulated inflation shall remain high carry statistical effect inflation last quarter scenario important ception inflation keep fall
copom understand moment inertia brazilian economy transfer impact last year shock high inflation year monetary policy firm enough eliminate risk shift inflation level copom evaluate additional effort monetary policy appropriate
besides copom understands economic policy action government also reaction society inflation important less costly reduction inflation sense recent measure adopt government aim reaffirm fiscal responsibility fiscal consistence together structural reform beneficial direct related area also boost monetary policy efficiency zilian experience clearly show effort society make keep price stable fundamental protect inflation tax regressive impact development strategy stability ensure pacity planning invest accurate predictability lengthening horizon
result copom decide unanimously increase target rate ward central bank board decide unanimously increase reserve requirement demand deposit contribute fall inflation coming month diversify instrument monetary policy close meeting announce committee would meet march technical presentation following day order discuss monetary policy guideline establish muniqué october
