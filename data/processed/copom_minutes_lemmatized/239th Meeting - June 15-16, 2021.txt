discussion conduct monetary policy
regard international outlook committee assess fiscal monetary stimulus promote robust economic growth late inflation release surprise several country develop emerge committee discussion risk permanent increase inflation united state could result challenging environment emerge economy copom note inflation tradable good brazil high several peer country process may reverse future create new downside risk inflation recent rise weight tradable item inflation index increase relevance event
copom member discuss evolution domestic economic activity light available information indicator consider despite intensity second wave pandemic late available data surprise positively duration problem supply chain also discuss committee second half year bring robust recovery effect vaccination felt broadly committee note median focus survey growth projection significantly revise become optimistic baseline scenario committee also assess downside risk inflation stem risk economic recovery reduce significantly
copom member debate level economic slack although economic slack whole rapidly return late level committee consider pandemic still produce heterogeneous effect across economic sector consequence recent prospective inflation dynamic copom judge economic activity formal labor market data suggest overall slack decline fast anticipate despite increase unemployment rate
next copom discuss implementation monetary policy consider baseline scenario also balance risk inflation accord baseline scenario use interest rate path extract focus survey inflation projection line target committee judge despite positive recent evolution fiscal risk continue imply upward bias projection asymmetry balance risk affect appropriate degree monetary stimulus thus justify path monetary policy less stimulative path use baseline scenario
copom evaluate different normalization path selic rate consider baseline scenario balance risk committee assess change inflation condition subsequent uninterrupted interest rate increase level consider neutral imply projection around inflation target relevant horizon therefore normalization interest rate level become appropriate committee decide communicate decision maintain transparency monetary policy path imply projection reaffirm view systematically reassess change inflation determinant balance risk occur
light revision monetary policy path imply projection committee evaluate quicker reduction monetary stimulus already meeting consider various alternative scenario committee decide best strategy would maintain current pace stimulus reduction highlight possibility quicker adjustment next meeting committee view strategy follow two advantage
first accumulate information regard traditional determinant inflation particular qualitative aspect evolution inertial price service sector recovers ii behavior inflation expectation focus survey market price
second clarify distinction transparency conditional projection invariant monetary policy intention unequivocal commitment banco central brasil inflation convergence target relevant horizon future monetary policy step freely adjust objective new information become available thus indication future path interest rate whether next meeting final level useful element understand response function monetary policy information obtain period copom meeting modify assumption present baseline scenario balance risk naturally change future path interest rate
monetary policy decision
take account baseline scenario balance risk broad array available information copom unanimously decide increase selic rate committee judge decision reflect baseline scenario prospective inflation variance balance risk consistent convergence inflation target relevant horizon monetary policy include without compromise fundamental objective ensure price stability decision also imply smoothing economic fluctuation foster full employment
moment copom baseline scenario indicate appropriate normalization policy rate level consider neutral adjustment necessary mitigate dissemination temporary shock inflation however committee emphasize commitment plan future step monetary policy could adjust assure achievement inflation target
next meeting committee foresee continuation monetary normalization process another adjustment magnitude however deterioration inflation expectation relevant horizon may require quick reduction monetary stimulus copom emphasize view also depend evolution economic activity balance risk factor affect inflation projection
