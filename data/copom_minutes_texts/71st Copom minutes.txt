Economic activity 

The indicators of  performance of the economic activity showed, at the end of the first quarter,  signs of slowing of the recovery started in October 2001. This tendency is only partially explained  by inventory level adjustments, mainly by industry, and to possible statistical seasonality effects  that  diminish March results. The loss of impetus is also attributed to the still modest growth of the  payroll, the absence of a more expressive recovery in credit , plus the exhaustion of the process of  recovery of consumer expectations that had been present since the end of last year.
