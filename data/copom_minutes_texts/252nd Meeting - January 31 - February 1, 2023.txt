 
A) Update of economic outlook and Copom’s scenario1 
1. The global environment continues to be marked by prospects of below-potential 
global growth for next year. The easing of the COVID policy in China, a milder winter in 
Europe, and the possibility of a gradual decline in the US growth soften the expected 
global economic slowdown for the coming quarters due to the tightening of financial 
conditions in major economies. 
2. The inflationary environment remains challenging, but recent data suggest some 
moderation at the margin in several countries. There is a normalization in supply chains 
and an accommodation in the prices of major commodities in the recent period, leading 
to a moderation in goods-related inflationary pressures. Conversely, the low degree of 
labor market slack in some economies, associated with a high current inflation and a 
high degree of inflation diffusion, suggests that inflationary pressures on the services 
sector should last longer. 
3. The process of normalization of monetary policy in advanced economies continues 
towards restrictive rates synchronized across countries, tightening financial conditions 
and impacting economic growth expectations. A long-lasting period of high interest 
rates is foreseen after the process of increasing interest rates, which calls for greater 
caution in the conduct of economic policies also by emerging economies  
4. Regarding the Brazilian economy, the set of indicators released since the previous 
Copom meeting continues to be in line with the scenario of deceleration expected by 
the Committee. It was observed that confidence indicators dropped and industrial 
production, trade, and services indicators downturned. The labor market, which 
surprised positively throughout 2022, still shows signs of deceleration, with a decline in 
net hirings in New CAGED and some stability in the unemployment rate stemming from 
setbacks in the employed population and the workforce.  
5. Notwithstanding the slowdown at the margin, consumer inflation remains high. The 
inflation of the components more sensitive to the economic cycle and the monetary 
policy, which present greater inflationary inertia, remain above the range compatible 
with meeting the inflation target, albeit showing some marginal moderation. Inflation 
expectations for 2023 and 2024 collected by the Focus survey are around 5.7% and 
3.9%, respectively. 
 
B) Scenarios and risk analysis  
6. In the reference scenario, the interest rate path is extracted from the Focus survey, 
and the exchange rate starts at USD/BRL 5.152 and evolves according to the purchasing 
power parity (PPP).  The Committee assumes that oil prices follow approximately the 
futures market curve for the following six months and then start increasing 2% per year 
onwards. Moreover, the energy flag is assumed to be “yellow” in December 2023 and 
2024. In this scenario, Copom’s inflation projections stand at 5.6% for 2023 and 3.4% 
for 2024. Inflation projections for administered prices are 10.6% for 2023 and 5.0% for 
2024. The Committee decided again to emphasize the six-quarter-ahead horizon. On 
this horizon, which refers to 2024Q3, the 12-month inflation projection stands at 3.6%. 
The Committee judges that the uncertainty in its assumptions and projections is higher 
than usual. 
7. The Committee analyzed an alternative scenario with stable interest rates 
throughout the entire relevant horizon. In this scenario, Copom’s inflation projections 
stand at 5.5% for 2023, 3.1% for 2024Q3, and 2.8% for 2024.

Copom meeting (251st meeting).

on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting. 

 
8. The Committee evaluated different assumptions, parameters, and scenarios in its 
discussion of inflation projections. On this subject, some members evaluated the 
possibility of incorporating some increase in the neutral interest rate, towards the 
movement observed in longer-term inflation expectations extracted from the Focus 
survey. The Committee chose, at this point, to maintain the neutral interest rate at 4%, 
but evaluated alternative scenarios and identified that the impacts on its projections of 
an increase in the neutral rate grow over time and become more relevant as of the 
second half of 2024.   
9. Copom assesses that the scenario for prospective global growth looks a little less 
challenging as a result of the change in China's COVID policy and of the mild winter in 
Europe. Some members emphasized that economic activity and labor market data 
remain relatively resilient in the US. In China, the adjustments in sanitary restrictions 
should lead to a cyclical recovery in demand and a reduction in the risks of supply 
disruptions. However, the Committee assesses that the Chinese long-term growth is 
expected to remain lower than observed in the pre-pandemic period, reflecting both 
the adjustments in the real estate sector and the worsened demographics expected in 
the coming years. In Europe, the milder winter has also reduced the likelihood of 
extreme scenarios in energy supply. In the US, economic activity data have been 
pointing to deceleration, but still in an environment of very pressured labor market. 
Despite these short-term developments, the Committee continues to assess that the 
commitment and determination of central banks to reduce inflationary pressures and 
anchor expectations consolidate a global scenario of tightening of financial conditions 
for a longer period, with rates at the end of the tightening cycle maintained for a 
sufficiently long period at contractionary levels, raising the risk of a more pronounced 
global deceleration. 
10. The Committee continues to assess that the process of global disinflation, 
especially regarding core inflation indicators, is challenging and will possibly happen 
more slowly than usually observed, since inflation is widespread in the services 
segment. However, some members highlighted the deceleration in the measures of 
core inflation in several countries.   
11. Data on economic activity in Brazil continues to indicate a more moderate pace of 
marginal growth and employment data suggest a loss of dynamism. Some members 
observed a movement towards partial recomposition of recent real wages losses, but 
judge that this movement is expected and is coupled with a deceleration in nominal 
gains that is expected to intensify ahead. The Committee will continue to monitor the 
labor market releases, continuously assessing the role of lagged inflation and labor 
market pressures on wage adjustments. The set of released data, including the drop in 
confidence indicators and the deceleration in credit grants, together with the lagged 
effects of monetary policy, reinforce the Committee's expectation of a slowdown in the 
pace of economic activity, which should worsen over the coming quarters. 
12. The Committee noted with particular concern the deterioration in longer-term 
inflation expectations. Such deterioration may have happened for several reasons, 
among them a possible perception of the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB) leniency with 
the targets set by the National Monetary Council (CMN), an expansionary fiscal policy 
that pressures the aggregate demand over the projection horizon, or the possibility of 
changes in the inflation targets already set.  
13. In the first case, the BCB reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy to 
achieve the established targets and assesses that, once the deanchoring is observed, it 
is necessary to remain even more vigilant in the conduct of monetary policy to reanchor 
expectations and thus reduce the future cost of the disinflation.  
14. In the second case, the Committee considers that demand stimuli should be 
assessed in view of the stage of the economic cycle and the degree of slack in the 
economy, with monetary policy being the macroeconomic adjustment variable used to 

 
mitigate any inflationary effects of the fiscal policy.  
15. Finally, regarding the third case, the BCB conducts monetary policy based on the 
targets set by the CMN. In summary, more important than analyzing the motivations for 
the rise in expectations, the Committee emphasizes that it will act to ensure that 
inflation converges to the targets.  
16. The Committee also discussed the impacts of the fiscal scenario on inflation. In this 
discussion, it was again emphasized that the net effect of the conduct of fiscal policy 
on inflation is very dependent on the prevailing macroeconomic and financial 
conditions. Thus, by analyzing the multiple channels, including the movement in 
financial conditions arising from future interest rates, and updating the assumptions for 
the fiscal path to incorporate the sanctioned budget for 2023, the Committee assesses 
that the scenario for activity has not changed significantly.  Some members have noted 
that the median projections of the Pre-Copom Questionnaire (PCQ) and the Focus 
survey for the 2023 primary deficit are much lower than that estimated in the federal 
budget, possibly incorporating the fiscal package announced by the Ministry of Finance. 
Copom sustained its usual governance of incorporating the policies already sanctioned 
by law, but it acknowledges that the implementation of the proposed fiscal package 
could reduce the upside inflation risk. 
17. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions. 
Among the upside risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation expectations, it should 
be emphasized (i) a greater persistence of global inflationary pressures; (ii) the still 
heightened uncertainty about the country's future fiscal framework and fiscal stimuli 
that support aggregate demand, partially incorporated in inflation expectations and 
asset prices; and (iii) an output gap tighter than the one currently adopted by the 
Committee in its reference scenario, especially in the labor market. Among the 
downside risks, it should be noted (i) an additional reduction in the prices of 
international commodities measured in local currency; (ii) a greater than projected 
deceleration of global economic activity; and (iii) the continuity of tax cuts assumed to 
be reversed in 2023.  
18. The current scenario, particularly uncertain on the fiscal side and with inflation 
expectations drifting away from the inflation target on longer horizons, calls for greater 
attention in the conduct of monetary policy.  The Committee judges that this scenario 
raises the cost of the disinflation that is needed to reach the targets established by the 
CMN. In this scenario, Copom reaffirms its commitment to set monetary policy to meet 
the targets. 
 
C) Discussion about the conduct of monetary policy 
19. Copom discussed the conduct of monetary policy, considering the set of projections 
evaluated, as well as the balance of risks for inflation. 
20. The Committee decided again to emphasize the six-quarter-ahead horizon for its 
projections but anticipates that, for the next quarter, it will resume adopting the usual 
horizon, according to the calendar years, since the six-quarter ahead horizon will 
coincide with the calendar year of 2024, and then there will be no direct effect of the 
tax changes in the usual horizon.  
21. The Committee began its debate by evaluating whether the previously outlined 
strategy of stable interest rates would be sufficient for the convergence of inflation to 
its targets. For this purpose, Copom analyzed the main determinants of the inflation 
trajectory and how they behaved more recently.  
22. Starting with the output gap, a deceleration in economic activity, credit, and more 
recently in the labor market was observed, as expected by the Committee given the 
monetary policy lags. In this regard, some members stressed that the deceleration 

 
should continue, and it is necessary for the monetary policy channels to act and for 
inflation to converge to its targets. It was also noted that economic growth prospects 
have not changed significantly in the recent period. 
23. Services inflation has moderated but remains at a level not compatible with the 
target. The Committee focuses on services inflation since it responds to inflationary 
inertia and economic activity more directly, and both factors are expected to put less 
inflationary pressures over the horizon. In any case, this dimension continues to call for 
attention, and the Committee continues to evaluate the speed with which the 
convergence process will take place.  
24. In the balance of risks, global inflationary pressures have eased, but there is still high 
uncertainty about the deceleration of the inflation process, which tends to be non-
linear. The risks are likely to persist as long as a tight labor market is observed in several 
advanced economies. Concerning domestic risks, two sets of risks intersect on fiscal 
issues. Firstly, the fiscal framework revision reduces the visibility on public accounts for 
the coming years, introduces premia on asset prices, and impacts inflation expectations. 
Secondly, concerning fiscal stimuli, Copom will continue to monitor their impact on 
economic activity and inflation and reinforces that, in an environment of a narrowed 
output gap, the impact on inflation tends to outweigh the desired impact on activity. 
Some members noted that the implementation of the Ministry of Finance fiscal package 
should mitigate the fiscal risk and consider that it will be important to monitor the 
challenges for its implementation. Finally, the risk of a tighter-than-evaluated output 
gap persists, and the Committee will continue to assess data and models for a more 
thorough understanding.  
25. Regarding downside inflation risks, international commodity prices in local currency 
have reduced, but the Committee assesses that the risk of a sharper slowdown in global 
economic activity remains on the horizon, despite this risk is to some degree reduced 
by China's reopening process. In this regard, the Committee will continue to monitor, 
on the one hand, the process of withdrawal of fiscal and monetary stimulus in advanced 
economies and, on the other hand, the Chinese reopening process.  
26. Regarding inflation expectations, the Committee notes with concern the recent 
movement at longer horizons. In addition to the direct impact of the rise in expectations 
on inflation projections, the rise in long-term expectations raises the cost of the 
disinflation by requiring greater participation of other monetary policy channels and, 
consequently, a wider output gap to obtain the same fall in inflation. The Committee 
will remain vigilant and will persist until the anchoring of expectations is consolidated.  
27. Copom’s projections have risen due to the increase in both administered and 
market prices. Among the preponderant factors for increased projections, the rise in 
Focus survey inflation expectations stands out. Projections conditioned by the 
assumptions of the reference scenario do not show convergence to the target over the 
relevant monetary policy horizon, but the introduction of a more extended monetary 
tightening, as in its alternative scenario, generates a relevant impact on the projections 
toward convergence to the targets.  
28. Copom chose to maintain the interest rate, reinforcing the need to evaluate, over 
time, the cumulative impacts to be observed of the intense and timely monetary policy 
cycle already undertaken. Therefore, the Committee assessed that, given the data 
released, the inflation projections and expectations, the balance of risks, and the lagged 
effects of the monetary policy already in significantly contractionary territory, it was 
appropriate to maintain the interest rate at the level of 13.75% p.a. The Committee 
reinforced that it is necessary to remain vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining 
the Selic rate for a longer period than in the reference scenario will be enough to ensure 
the convergence of inflation. 
29. The Committee emphasizes that it will persist until the disinflationary process 
consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets, which have shown 

 
deterioration at longer horizons since the previous meeting. The Committee 
emphasizes that it will not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary 
process does not proceed as expected. 
 
D) Monetary policy decision 
30. Considering the assessed scenarios, the balance of risks, and the broad array of 
available information, Copom decided to maintain the Selic rate at 13.75% p.a. The 
Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for 
prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks and is 
consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target 
throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2023 and, to a 
larger degree, 2024. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price 
stability, this decision also implies smoothing economic fluctuations and fostering full 
employment. 
31. The Committee remains vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic 
rate for a longer period than in the reference scenario will be enough to ensure the 
convergence of inflation. The Committee emphasizes that it will persist until the 
disinflationary process consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its 
targets, which have shown deterioration at longer horizons since the previous meeting. 
The Committee reinforces that future monetary policy steps can be adjusted and will 
not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary process does not 
proceed as expected. 
32. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto de 
Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor), Bruno Serra Fernandes, Carolina de Assis Barros, 
Diogo Abry Guillen, Fernanda Magalhães Rumenos Guardado, Maurício Costa de Moura, 
Otávio Ribeiro Damaso, Paulo Sérgio Neves de Souza, and Renato Dias de Brito Gomes.
