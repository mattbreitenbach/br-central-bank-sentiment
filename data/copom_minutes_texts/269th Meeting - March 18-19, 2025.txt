 
A) Update of the economic outlook and the Copom’s scenario1 
1. The global environment remains challenging due to the economic policy and outlook 
in the United States, mainly due to the uncertainty about trade policy and its effects. 
This scenario poses even more questions about the pace of economic deceleration, 
disinflation and, consequently, about the Fed’s monetary policy stance and the pace of 
growth in other countries. 
2. The central banks of major economies remain committed to bringing inflation back 
to its targets in a context characterized by labor market pressures. The Committee 
judges that the external environment continues to require caution from emerging 
market economies. 
3. Regarding the domestic scenario, the set of indicators on economic activity and labor 
market has been exhibiting strength, even though we observe signals that suggest an 
incipient moderation in growth. 
4. Headline inflation and measures of underlying inflation remain above the inflation 
target and have again increased in recent releases. Inflation expectations for 2025 and 
2026 collected by the Focus survey increased significantly and stand at 5.7% and 4.5%, 
respectively. 
 
B) Scenarios and risk analysis  
5. The inflation outlook remains challenging in several dimensions. The Committee 
analyzed economic activity, aggregate demand, inflation expectations, current 
inflation, and the international scenario. Copom then discussed inflation projections 
and expectations before deliberating on the current decision and future 
communication. 
6. The Committee continues to evaluate that the prospective baseline scenario involves 
a slowdown in economic activity, which is part of the monetary policy transmission 
process and an element necessary for the convergence of inflation to the target. Data 
for the last few months continue to sign an incipient moderation in growth, in line with 
the Copom's baseline scenario. The Committee reinforced that some more recent 
indicators, such as those for services, industry, or the employed population, have 
pointed to a moderation in growth after extraordinary resilience in the labor market 
and economic activity. The seasonally adjusted Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 
0.2% in 2024Q4 over 2024Q3, following expansions of 1.3% and 0.7% in the second and 
third quarters of the year, respectively. On the same comparison basis, on the 
aggregate demand side, household consumption declined, after a sequence of thirteen 
consecutive increases. That said, there are still few conclusions in the understanding of 
(i) the past, which is subject to revisions and seasonality; (ii) the present, with mixed 
contemporaneous data that are not unequivocal in one direction and; (iii) the future, in 
light, for example, of anticipated strong agricultural growth in the first quarter with 
possible consequences for other sectors. The Committee also emphasized that soft 
data, such as those from confidence indicators and credit sentiment surveys, have 
suggested a greater slowdown than that observed in the hard data. Moreover, 
coincident hard data have shown mixed results depending on the sector or the 
indicator. Lastly, in the labor market, in addition to inherent data volatility, employed 
population has declined at the margin, but in an environment of low unemployment 
and high income. Although recent data suggests some moderation, the labor market 
remains heated. The Committee will continue to monitor economic activity and 
reiterates that the aggregate demand slowdown is an essential element of supply-
demand rebalancing in the economy and inflation convergence to the target.  
 
1 Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this update considers changes since the January Copom meeting (268th 
meeting). 

 
7. The credit market has also remained strong in recent quarters due to the dynamism 
of the labor market and economic activity. However, in line with the current scenario of 
tighter financial conditions and higher risk premiums, bank credit has shown some 
inflection more recently, with an increase in interest rates, lower risk appetite in the 
credit supply, and a slower pace of credit granting. Therefore, one expects a scenario 
marked, on the one hand, by a high household service-to-income ratio, but, on the other 
hand, the continuity of the dynamism in the private securities market. 
8. Regarding economic policy more broadly, the most emphasized issue was the 
relevance of maintaining unobstructed monetary policy channels, with no elements 
mitigating its action. Monetary policy acts through different channels, including credit, 
leading the volume of loans to react to financial conditions and to expectations, as 
prospective assessments impact current consumption and investment. In order to fulfill 
its mandate and the convergence of inflation to the target at the lowest cost, monetary 
policy must be able to act with all channels unobstructed.  
9. The Committee remained firmly convinced that policies must be predictable, 
credible, and countercyclical. In particular, the Committee's debate once again 
highlighted the need for harmonious fiscal and monetary policies. More recently, 
agents' perception about the fiscal regime and debt sustainability continued to impact 
asset prices and expectations significantly. Copom reinforced its view that the 
slowdown in structural reform efforts and fiscal discipline, the increase in earmarked 
credit, and uncertainties over the public debt stabilization have the potential to raise 
the economy's neutral interest rate, with deleterious impacts on the power of monetary 
policy and, consequently, on the cost of disinflation in terms of activity. 
10. Inflation expectations, measured by different instruments and obtained from 
different groups of agents, have risen again in all terms, indicating further deanchoring 
and thus making the inflation scenario more adverse. Deanchored inflation 
expectations is a factor of discomfort shared by all Committee members and must be 
tamed. Copom highlighted that environments with deanchored expectations increase 
the disinflation cost in terms of activity. The scenario of inflation convergence to the 
target becomes more challenging with deanchored expectations for longer horizons 
and requires higher rates and for a longer period than would be otherwise appropriate. 
11. Short-term inflation scenario remains adverse. Services inflation, which has greater 
inertia, remains above the level required to meet the inflation target and has 
accelerated in the most recent readings, in a context of a positive output gap. As for 
industrialized goods, the recent movement of the exchange rate has pressured prices 
and margins, already materialized in a rise in wholesale prices, suggesting that it will 
pass through to retail prices in the coming months. Food prices remain high and tend 
to spread over other prices on the medium term given the presence of important 
inertial mechanisms in the Brazilian economy. Lastly, in the short-term analysis it was 
highlighted that, if confirmed the reference scenario projections, the 12-month 
inflation will remain above the upper limit of the inflation target tolerance interval for 
six consecutive months as of January 2025. Therefore, there would be a target breach 
with the June 2025 inflation under the new inflation-targeting framework. 
12. Prospectively, the Committee will monitor the pace of economic activity, which is 
fundamental in determining inflation, particularly services inflation; the exchange rate 
pass-through to inflation, after a process of increased exchange rate volatility; and 
inflation expectations, which have shown further deanchoring and are drivers of the 
future inflation behavior. It was emphasized that inflationary vectors remain adverse, 
such as a positive output gap, higher current inflation, and more deanchored inflation 
expectations.  
13. The external environment remains challenging, with significant economic and 
geopolitical uncertainties. It is assessed that there is a concomitant increase in 
uncertainty and a deterioration of the global growth scenario compared with the 
previous Copom meeting. Copom's baseline scenario continues to predict a gradual and 

 
orderly slowdown of the U.S. economy, but, in addition to the inherent uncertainties of 
the economic outlook, there are doubts about the conduct of economic policy in various 
dimensions, such as possible fiscal stimuli; labor supply restrictions; scope and intensity 
of the import tariffs rising; and significant changes in relative prices resulting from shifts 
in the energy matrix, which could negatively impact financial conditions and capital 
flows to emerging market economies. The uncertainty surrounding these policies is 
already restricting new investments and affects activity. Similarly, uncertainty about the 
implementation of tariffs also affects expectations, price determination, and inflation. 
Therefore, part of this scenario deterioration, also discussed in recent meetings, is 
already starting to materialize. Moreover, there is renewed pressure in Europe to 
expand public spending, financed by debt issuance. Such movements tend to tighten 
global financial conditions, raising rates and potentially pressuring the exchange rate in 
emerging market economies. The Committee reinforced that the central banks' 
commitment to achieving their targets is a fundamental ingredient in the disinflationary 
process, corroborated by recent indications of cautious monetary easing cycles in 
several countries. As usual, the Committee will focus on the transmission mechanisms 
from the external environment to the domestic inflation dynamics and their impact on 
the outlook. It was also emphasized that a context of greater global uncertainty and 
more abrupt exchange rate movements requires greater caution in the conduct of 
domestic monetary policy. 
14. Copom then addressed the projections. In the reference scenario, the interest rate 
path is extracted from the Focus survey, and the exchange rate starts at USD/BRL 5.802 
and evolves according to the purchasing power parity (PPP). The Committee assumes 
that oil prices follow approximately the futures market curve for the following six 
months and then start increasing 2% per year. Moreover, the energy tariff flag is 
assumed to be “green” in December 2025. 
15. In the reference scenario, four-quarter inflation projections for 2025 and for the 
third quarter of 2026 – the current relevant monetary policy horizon – are 5.1% and 
3.9%, respectively (Table 1).  
16. The balance of risks remains asymmetrical, indicating a greater probability of higher 
inflation than that in the baseline scenario. Among the upside risks for the inflation 
outlook and inflation expectations, it should be emphasized (i) a more prolonged period 
of deanchoring of inflation expectations; (ii) a stronger-than-expected resilience of 
services inflation due to a more positive output gap; and (iii) a conjunction of internal 
and external economic policies with a stronger-than-expected inflationary impact, for 
example, through a persistently more depreciated currency. Among the downside risks, 
it should be noted (i) impacts on the inflation scenario in the case of a greater-than-
projected deceleration of domestic economic activity; and (ii) a less inflationary scenario 
for emerging market economies arising from shocks on international trade or global 
financial conditions. 
 
C) Discussion of the conduct of monetary policy 
17. Copom then discussed the conduct of monetary policy, considering the set of 
projections evaluated, as well as the balance of risks for prospective inflation. 
18. In the Committee's analysis, the scenario unfolded in such a way that the previous 
indication of a 1.00 p.p. increase in the Selic rate deemed to be the right decision. It was 
assessed that monetary tightening was required for the convergence of inflation to the 
target in a scenario marked by deanchored expectations, high inflation projections, and 
resilient activity.  
 
2 It corresponds to the rounded value of the average exchange rate observed over the ten working days 
ending on the last day of the week prior to the Copom meeting, according to the procedure adopted since 
the 258th meeting. 

 
19. In its communication, the Committee chose to combine three indications regarding 
the conduct of monetary policy, should the expected scenario be confirmed. Firstly, it 
assessed that, given the adverse scenario for inflation dynamics, it was appropriate to 
indicate that the cycle has not come to an end. Secondly, due to the lags inherent to the 
ongoing monetary cycle, the Committee also deemed appropriate to communicate that 
the next move would be of a smaller magnitude. Furthermore, given the heightened 
uncertainty, it decided to indicate only the direction of the next move.  
20. Beyond the next meeting, the total magnitude of the tightening cycle will be 
determined by the firm commitment of reaching the inflation target and will depend 
on the inflation dynamics, especially the components that are more sensitive to 
monetary policy and economic activity, on the inflation projections, on the inflation 
expectations, on the output gap, and on the balance of risks. 
 
D) Monetary policy decision 
21. The current scenario is marked by additional deanchoring of inflation expectations, 
high inflation projections, resilience on economic activity, and labor market pressures, 
which requires a more contractionary monetary policy. 
22. Copom therefore decided to increase the Selic rate by 1.00 p.p. to 14.25% p.a., and 
judges that this decision is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a 
level around its target throughout the relevant monetary policy horizon. Without 
compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also 
implies smoothing economic fluctuations and fostering full employment. 
23. In light of the continuation of the adverse scenario for inflation convergence, the 
heightened uncertainty and the lags inherent to the ongoing monetary tightening 
cycle, the Committee anticipates an adjustment of lower magnitude in the next 
meeting, if the scenario evolves as expected. Beyond the next meeting, the Committee 
reinforces that the total magnitude of the tightening cycle will be determined by the 
firm commitment of reaching the inflation target and will depend on the inflation 
dynamics, especially the components that are more sensitive to monetary policy and 
economic activity, on the inflation projections, on the inflation expectations, on the 
output gap, and on the balance of risks. 
24. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Gabriel Muricca 
Galípolo (Governor), Ailton de Aquino Santos, Diogo Abry Guillen, Gilneu Francisco 
Astolfi Vivan, Izabela Moreira Correa, Nilton José Schneider David, Paulo Picchetti, 
Renato Dias de Brito Gomes, and Rodrigo Alves Teixeira.
